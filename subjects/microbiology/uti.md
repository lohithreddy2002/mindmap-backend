# UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) - INICET High Yield

## Definition
- Infection of urinary tract

## Classification
- ### Uncomplicated vs Complicated
  - Uncomplicated: Healthy, non-pregnant adult female, no structural/functional abnormalities
  - Complicated: Male, pregnant, children, elderly, immunosuppressed, structural/functional abnormalities, catheter, recent instrumentation, hospital acquired
- ### Lower (Cystitis) vs Upper (Pyelonephritis)
  - Cystitis: Bladder and below
  - Pyelonephritis: Kidney parenchyma and pelvis
- ### Recurrent UTI
  - ≥2 infections in 6 months or ≥3 in 1 year
- ### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB)
  - Significant bacteriuria without symptoms

## Epidemiology & Risk Factors
- Female sex (short urethra)
- Sexual activity (esp. new partner, spermicide use)
- Pregnancy
- Catheterization (CAUTI)
- Structural/Functional abnormalities (VUR, obstruction, neurogenic bladder)
- Diabetes mellitus
- Immunosuppression
- Elderly & Infants (atypical presentation)
- History of prior UTI

## Etiology (Common Organisms)
- ### Gram-negative (Most Common)
  - Escherichia coli (Most frequent, 70-95%)
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Proteus mirabilis (struvite stones)
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (complicated, nosocomial)
- ### Gram-positive
  - Staphylococcus saprophyticus (Young, sexually active women)
  - Enterococcus species (Complicated, hospital acquired)

## Clinical Presentation
- ### Cystitis
  - Dysuria (painful urination)
  - Frequency (↑ urge, ↓ volume)
  - Urgency (sudden, strong urge)
  - Suprapubic pain/discomfort
  - Hematuria (common)
- ### Pyelonephritis
  - Fever, Chills
  - Flank pain (unilateral/bilateral)
  - Costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness
  - Nausea, Vomiting
  - Systemic illness
- ### Special Populations
  - Children: Fever, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, failure to thrive (often non-specific)
  - Elderly: Delirium, confusion, falls, incontinence (often atypical/non-specific)

## Diagnosis
- ### Urinalysis (UA)
  - Leukocyte esterase (indicates pyuria)
  - Nitrites (indicates G-ve bacteria reducing nitrates)
  - Pyuria (WBC > 10/hpf)
  - Bacteria (bacteriuria)
  - Hematuria (variable)
  - Microscopic examination
- ### Urine Culture & Sensitivity (C&S)
  - Gold Standard
  - Required for complicated UTI, pyelonephritis, recurrent UTI, children, males, pregnant women, ASB (when treating)
  - Significant bacteriuria thresholds vary (e.g., >10^5 CFU/mL in uncomplicated female, lower in symptomatic/complicated)
- ### Imaging
  - Indicated in: Pyelonephritis (severe, failure to respond), Recurrent UTI, Complicated UTI, Children, Suspected obstruction/structural issue

## Management
- ### Uncomplicated Cystitis
  - Short course antibiotics (3-5 days)
  - First line: Nitrofurantoin (avoid in pyelo/CrCl < 30), TMP-SMX (resistance increasing), Fosfomycin (single dose)
  - Second line: Fluoroquinolones (reserve due to resistance/side effects), Beta-lactams (less effective)
  - Symptomatic relief: Phenazopyridine (urinary analgesic - NOT a treatment)
- ### Complicated UTI
  - Longer course (7-14 days)
  - Broader spectrum antibiotics initially (often fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam)
  - Tailor based on C&S
  - Address underlying cause
- ### Pyelonephritis
  - Outpatient (mild/moderate): Oral fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX (if sensitive)
  - Inpatient (severe/septic/unable to tolerate oral/pregnant): IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam), Step down to oral after clinical improvement (total course 10-14 days)
- ### Recurrent UTI Management
  - Behavioral modification (post-coital voiding, hydration)
  - Vaginal estrogen (post-menopausal women)
  - Antibiotic prophylaxis (low dose daily, post-coital, or patient-initiated self-treatment)
  - Cranberry products (controversial evidence)
- ### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB)
  - **DO NOT TREAT** except in:
    - Pregnancy (ALWAYS treat to prevent pyelo, low birth weight, preterm labor)
    - Prior to invasive urological procedures
- ### UTI in Pregnancy
  - Always treat ASB and symptomatic UTI
  - Safe antibiotics: Nitrofurantoin (avoid in 1st/3rd tri), Cephalexin, Amoxicillin
  - AVOID: TMP-SMX (1st tri-neural tube defects, 3rd tri-kernicterus), Fluoroquinolones (cartilage damage), Tetracyclines (teeth/bone)
- ### UTI in Children
  - Prompt treatment to prevent renal scarring
  - Investigate underlying cause (VCUG for VUR, renal ultrasound)
  - Antibiotic choice based on age and local resistance (TMP-SMX, cephalexin, amoxicillin)
- ### Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI)
  - Most common nosocomial infection
  - Symptoms often atypical
  - Remove catheter if possible
  - Treat **ONLY** if symptomatic (exceptions: specific urologic procedures, neutropenic, renal transplant)
  - **DO NOT TREAT ASB** in catheterized patients (unless specific situations)

## Important INICET Buzzwords
- E. coli (most common)
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus (honeymoon cystitis)
- Leukocyte esterase
- Nitrites
- Pyuria (>10 WBCs/hpf)
- Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (Treat only in pregnancy/pre-procedure)
- Nitrofurantoin (avoid pyelo/CrCl < 30)
- TMP-SMX (resistance, avoid in 1st/3rd tri pregnancy)
- Fosfomycin (single dose)
- Fluoroquinolones (reserve, avoid pregnancy/children)
- Pyelonephritis (fever, flank pain, CVA tenderness)
- Recurrent UTI (definition, prophylaxis)
- Pregnancy (always treat ASB, safe drugs)
- Children (investigate cause, scarring risk)
- CAUTI (most common HAP, remove catheter, don't treat ASB usually)
- VUR (Vesicoureteral Reflux)
- VCUG (Voiding Cystourethrogram)
