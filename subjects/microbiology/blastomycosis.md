## Blastomycosis

- **Etiology**
  - *Blastomyces dermatitidis* (*B. gilchristii* etc.)
  - Dimorphic fungus
  - Inhalation of conidia from soil/wood

- **Epidemiology**
  - Endemic: **Mississippi, Ohio River Valleys**, **Great Lakes**, Southeastern US, Canada (bordering lakes)
  - Associated with soil, decaying organic matter

- **Pathology/Microscopy**
  - In tissues (Yeast form):
    - **Broad-based budding**
    - **Large size (8-15 µm)**
    - Thick refractile wall
    - Single bud

- **Clinical Manifestations**
  - Most common: **Pulmonary**
    - Asymptomatic to acute flu-like
    - Chronic pneumonia (mimics TB/cancer)
    - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
  - **Disseminated Disease** (Common sites)
    - **Skin:** **Verrucous** / Warty lesions
      - Raised, undermined borders
      - Microabscesses
      - Scarring upon healing
    - **Bone:** Osteomyelitis (Lytic lesions)
    - **Genitourinary:** Prostatitis, Epididymitis
    - **CNS:** Meningitis, Brain abscesses
    - Less common: Joints, Adrenals, Liver, Spleen

- **Diagnosis**
  - **Microscopy:** (High yield!)
    - KOH or Calcofluor white stain on sputum, BAL, pus, tissue biopsy, urine sediment
    - Visualize **Broad-based budding yeasts**
  - **Culture:** (Gold standard, but slow)
    - 2-4 weeks for growth
    - Mold form (25°C), Yeast form (37°C)
  - **Antigen Detection:**
    - **Urine antigen** (Sensitive, esp. disseminated)
    - Serum antigen
    - Cross-reactivity with Histoplasma
  - Histopathology (Biopsy): Granulomatous inflammation + characteristic yeasts
  - Serology: Less reliable (Immunodiffusion, Complement Fixation)

- **Treatment**
  - **Mild/Moderate Pulmonary:**
    - **Itraconazole** (oral)
    - Duration: 6-12 months
  - **Severe/Disseminated/CNS:**
    - **Amphotericin B** (IV, lipid formulations preferred initially)
    - Followed by **Itraconazole** (oral) consolidation/maintenance
    - Duration: 12 months (for CNS), longer for some cases

- **INICET Buzzwords**
  - **Broad-based budding**
  - **Large yeast**
  - **Ohio River Valley**
  - **Mississippi River Valley**
  - **Great Lakes**
  - **Verrucous skin lesions**
  - **Urine Antigen**
  - Osteomyelitis
  - Prostatitis
  - Dimorphic fungus
