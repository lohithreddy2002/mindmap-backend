# Parainfluenza Virus

## Classification
- Family: Paramyxoviridae
  - Genus: Respirovirus (HPIV 1, 3)
  - Genus: Rubulavirus (HPIV 2, 4)
- Envelope: Yes
- Genome: Single-stranded, Negative-sense RNA

## Epidemiology
- Second most common cause of LRTI in children after RSV
- **HPIV 1 & 2:** Biennial outbreaks (fall)
- **HPIV 3:** Annual outbreaks (spring/summer)
- **HPIV 4:** Less common, sporadic

## Pathogenesis
- Transmission: Respiratory droplets
- Replication: Epithelial cells of respiratory tract
- Causes inflammation, edema, mucus production
  - Especially subglottic region (Croup)
  - Small airways (Bronchiolitis)
  - Alveoli (Pneumonia)

## Clinical Presentations
- **HPIV 1 & 2:**
  - **Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)** - Most common cause (60-70%)
    - Barking cough
    - Stridor (inspiratory)
    - Hoarseness
    - Fever (often low-grade)
    - Worse at night
- **HPIV 3:**
  - **Bronchiolitis**
  - **Pneumonia**
  - More severe disease in infants & young children
  - Can cause Croup, but less frequently than HPIV 1/2
- **HPIV 4:**
  - Usually milder URI symptoms
  - Can cause LRTI

## Diagnosis
- **Clinical:** Based on signs & symptoms (especially Croup)
- **Rapid Antigen Detection:** Less sensitive than PCR
- **PCR (RT-PCR):**
  - Most sensitive & specific
  - Detects multiple respiratory viruses
  - Used in multiplex panels
- Viral Culture: Slow, less common for routine diagnosis

## Management
- **Supportive Care:**
  - Hydration
  - Humidified air/cool mist
  - Antipyretics
- **Croup:**
  - **Mild:** Humidified air, hydration
  - **Moderate/Severe:**
    - **Dexamethasone (single dose):** Reduces edema (buzzword: **Systemic Corticosteroids**)
    - **Nebulized Epinephrine:** Transient relief of stridor (vasoconstriction) - consider for moderate/severe symptoms
    - Observe post-epinephrine for rebound
- **Bronchiolitis/Pneumonia:**
  - Supportive care
  - Oxygen if hypoxic
  - IV fluids if poor feeding
- Antibiotics: Not indicated unless secondary bacterial infection suspected

## Complications
- Dehydration
- Respiratory failure
- Secondary bacterial infection (e.g., pneumonia, otitis media)
- Subglottic stenosis (rare)

## Prevention
- No vaccine currently available
