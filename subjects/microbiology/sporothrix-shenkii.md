# Sporothrix schenckii (INICET High Yield)

## Microbiology
- **Classification:** Fungus, Dimorphic
- **Morphology:**
  - **Mold form (25째C):** Branching hyphae, conidia (often flowerette/rosette, sometimes sleeve-like)
  - **Yeast form (37째C / tissue):** Oval/cigar-shaped bodies
- **Culture:**
  - Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA)
  - Mold form: Leathery/velvety colony, white to black
  - Yeast form: Creamy, yeast-like colony

## Epidemiology
- **Source:** Soil, decaying vegetation, wood, sphagnum moss, thorns (classic: roses)
- **Transmission:**
  - Traumatic implantation (most common)
  - Inhalation (pulmonary form)
  - Zoonotic (cats)
- **Risk factors:** Gardeners, farmers, forestry workers, cat owners (especially in endemic areas like Brazil)

## Clinical Manifestations (Sporotrichosis)
- **Lymphocutaneous (Most common):**
  - Initial lesion: Papule/nodule at inoculation site, often ulcerates
  - Secondary lesions: Nodules along lymphatic drainage path (classic feature)
  - Not painful, non-pruritic
- **Fixed Cutaneous:**
  - Localized lesion, often larger plaque or ulcer
  - No lymphatic spread
- **Pulmonary:**
  - Inhalation of conidia
  - Chronic cavities, resembles TB
- **Disseminated:**
  - Rare, immunocompromised hosts
  - Involvement of bones, joints, lungs, CNS, etc.

## Diagnosis
- **Culture:** **Gold standard**, SDA at 25째C (mold) and Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) at 37째C (yeast conversion)
- **Microscopy:**
  - Tissue biopsy: Yeast forms (cigar-shaped), **Asteroid body** (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon around yeast)
  - Direct microscopic exam of pus/tissue: Low yield
- **Histopathology:** Granulomatous inflammation
- **Serology:** Agglutination tests (useful for disseminated/pulmonary forms)
- **PCR:** Increasingly used

## Treatment
- **Lymphocutaneous/Fixed Cutaneous:**
  - **Itraconazole:** Drug of choice (3-6 months)
  - Saturated Solution of Potassium Iodide (SSKI): Historical, less common now, side effects
- **Pulmonary/Disseminated/Severe:**
  - **Amphotericin B:** Initial treatment, followed by Itraconazole
- **Duration:** Continue therapy for 2-4 weeks after clinical cure
