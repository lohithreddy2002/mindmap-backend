# Non-Gonococcal Urethritis (NGU)

## Etiology (High Yield Causes)
- *Chlamydia trachomatis* (Most Common - 30-50%)
- *Mycoplasma genitalium* (15-20%)
- *Ureaplasma urealyticum* (10-20%)
- Adenovirus (especially in homosexual men)
- HSV
- *Trichomonas vaginalis*
- Unknown (Non-Chlamydial Non-Mycoplasmal NGU)

## Clinical Features
- Dysuria (burning on urination)
- Urethral discharge (Mucopurulent, clear, or scant)
- Urethral itching/irritation
- **Often asymptomatic** (especially in women and a significant minority of men)
- Meatal redness

## Diagnosis
- **First Catch Urine** (FCU)
  - **NAAT** (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) - Gold standard for *Chlamydia*, *Mycoplasma*, etc.
- Urethral Swab (less preferred than FCU if NAAT available)
  - Gram Stain (Rule out Gonorrhea - Absence of Gram-negative intracellular diplococci)
  - Microscopy (Presence of >5 PMNs per high-power field - Sensitive but not specific)
- Clinical Diagnosis (often based on symptoms and ruling out Gonorrhea)

## Treatment
- **First Line (Empirical)**
  - **Azithromycin** (1g single dose) - Effective against *Chlamydia*, some *Mycoplasma*, *Ureaplasma*.
  - **Doxycycline** (100mg BD x 7 days) - Effective against *Chlamydia*, *Ureaplasma*. Often preferred for *Mycoplasma genitalium* suspect/confirmed (used with Moxifloxacin or Azithromycin depending on resistance).
- **Treatment for *Mycoplasma genitalium*** (Considered if NGU persists or high index of suspicion)
  - Doxycycline (7 days) followed by Moxifloxacin (400mg OD x 7 days) OR High-dose Azithromycin regimen (1g day 1, then 500mg days 2-5)
- Treat Sexual Partners (within last 60 days)
- Abstinence during treatment

## Complications
- Epididymitis
- Prostatitis
- Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's Syndrome)
  - **Triad**: Urethritis, Arthritis, Conjunctivitis (**Can't See, Can't Pee, Can't Climb a Tree**)
  - Keratoderma blennorrhagica
- Proctitis (in receptive anal intercourse)
- Conjunctivitis/Keratitis
