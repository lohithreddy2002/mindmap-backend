## Prozone Phenomenon

- Definition
  - False negative result
  - Occurs at high concentration of antibody or antigen

- Mechanism
  - **Antibody Excess (Most Common)**
    - Too many antibodies
    - Antibodies coat all antigen sites
    - Prevents formation of lattice required for visible agglutination/precipitation
    - Leads to non-agglutination/non-precipitation
  - Antigen Excess (Less Common)
    - Too many antigens
    - Antibodies bind to single antigen sites
    - Prevents lattice formation

- Clinical Significance
  - Leads to misdiagnosis
  - Delay in treatment

- How to Detect/Overcome
  - Dilute the serum (serial dilutions)
  - Repeat the test

- Examples (High-Yield INICET)
  - **Syphilis Serology (VDRL/RPR)**
    - Primary or Secondary Syphilis
    - High antibody titer (reagin antibodies)
    - Requires serum dilution
  - **Brucellosis (Tube Agglutination Test)**
    - Acute Brucellosis
    - High antibody titer
  - Fungal Serology (e.g., Cryptococcus - Latex agglutination for capsular antigen)
    - High antigen load
  - Monospot Test (Infectious Mononucleosis)
  - Rose-Waaler Test (Rheumatoid Arthritis)
  - Coombs Test (DAT/IAT)

- Types of Reactions Affected
  - Agglutination Tests
  - Precipitation Tests
  - ELISA (hook effect - high antigen/antibody causing saturation)
