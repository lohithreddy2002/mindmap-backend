## Talaromyces marnefii

- **General**
  - Dimorphic fungus
  - Formerly *Penicillium marneffei*
  - Endemic in Southeast Asia, Southern China, Northeast India
  - Associated with bamboo rats (*Rhizomys sinensis*)
- **Morphology**
  - **Mold form (25°C)**
    - Aerial hyphae
    - Conidiophores with verticils of metulae and phialides
    - Oval conidia
    - Diffusible red pigment in culture
  - **Yeast form (37°C)**
    - Intracellular within macrophages/histiocytes
    - Oval to elongated cells (2-6 µm)
    - Characteristic transverse septation ("bamboo shoot", "sausage shape")
- **Epidemiology & Risk Factors**
  - Acquired via inhalation of conidia
  - Most common systemic mycosis in HIV in endemic areas
  - High risk: Immunosuppression, especially HIV with CD4 < 100 cells/µL
  - Other risks: Organ transplant, prolonged corticosteroid use, TNF-alpha inhibitors
- **Clinical Presentation**
  - Disseminated disease most common in immunocompromised
  - **Systemic:** Fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise
  - **Skin:** Most characteristic - multiple papules/nodules, often umbilicated (mimicking molluscum contagiosum), can be widely distributed
  - **Hematologic:** Anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia
  - **Reticuloendothelial:** Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy
  - **Pulmonary:** Cough, dyspnea, infiltrates
  - **GI:** Diarrhea, abdominal pain
  - **Other:** Joint pain, bone lesions, CNS involvement (less common)
- **Diagnosis**
  - **Microscopy:**
    - Giemsa/Wright stain of peripheral blood/bone marrow/skin biopsy/lymph node aspirate
    - H&E stain of tissue biopsy
    - Show intracellular yeasts with transverse septation
  - **Culture:**
    - Gold standard
    - Samples: Blood, bone marrow, skin biopsy, lymph node, respiratory secretions
    - Grows faster than *Histoplasma* (typically 3-7 days)
    - Identify by characteristic mold morphology (red pigment) and yeast form conversion
  - **Histopathology:**
    - Intracellular yeasts in macrophages
    - Granulomatous or suppurative inflammation
  - **Molecular:** PCR (increasingly used)
  - **Antigen Detection:** Galactomannan (less sensitive than for *Aspergillus*), specific antigen assays under development
- **Treatment**
  - **Induction:**
    - Severe/disseminated: Amphotericin B (preferably lipid formulation) IV for 2 weeks
    - Mild/moderate: Itraconazole oral for 2 weeks
  - **Consolidation/Maintenance:**
    - Itraconazole oral for 10-12 months
  - **Secondary Prophylaxis:**
    - Itraconazole oral, especially in HIV until immune reconstitution (CD4 > 100 cells/µL for > 6 months)
  - **IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome):** Can occur in HIV patients after starting ART; manage with steroids in severe cases.
