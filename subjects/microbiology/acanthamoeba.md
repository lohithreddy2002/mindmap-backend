## Acanthamoeba

- **Morphology**
  - Trophozoite (Active, feeding, reproduces by binary fission)
  - Cyst (Resistant form, double-walled)
- **Life Cycle**
  - Two stages only (Trophozoite & Cyst)
  - No obligatory parasitic stage in humans
- **Transmission**
  - Contaminated Water (Tap water, hot tubs, lakes)
  - Contact Lenses (Poor hygiene, contaminated solution, sleeping with lenses)
  - Soil, Air
  - Inhalation
- **Clinical Syndromes**
  - **Acanthamoeba Keratitis (AK)**
    - High Yield topic for INICET
    - Risk Factors: Contact lens wear (esp. soft lenses), Exposure to contaminated water, Trauma
    - Symptoms: Severe pain (out of proportion to clinical signs), Photophobia, Red eye, Blurred vision
    - Signs: Ring infiltrate (classic, late sign), Radial keratoneuritis (early, pathognomonic), Pseudodendrites, Stromal infiltrates, Anterior uveitis
    - Diagnosis:
      - Corneal Scraping (Gold standard)
      - Microscopy (Wet mount, Gram, Giemsa, PAS, Calcofluor white stain)
      - Culture (Non-nutrient agar with E. coli/Klebsiella lawn - preferred method)
      - In vivo Confocal Microscopy (Rapid, non-invasive for live imaging)
      - PCR
    - Treatment:
      - Topical Biguanides (Polyhexamethylene biguanide - PHMB, Chlorhexidine)
      - Topical Diamidines (Propamidine, Hexamidine)
      - Combination therapy is common
      - Intensive initial therapy
      - Keratoplasty may be needed for scarring/perforation
  - **Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE)**
    - More common in Immunocompromised hosts (HIV, organ transplant)
    - Entry via respiratory tract, skin, or disseminated from other sites
    - Symptoms: Fever, Headache, Stiff neck, Seizures, Altered mental status, Cranial nerve palsies, Focal neurological deficits
    - Diagnosis: CSF (may show trophozoites/cysts), Brain biopsy (definitive - shows granulomas with amebae), Imaging (CT/MRI)
    - Prognosis: Poor, often fatal
    - Treatment: Combination therapy (e.g., Miltefosine, Voriconazole, Pentamidine, Sulfadiazine) - variable success
  - **Disseminated Infection**
    - Rare, mainly in immunocompromised
    - Can involve skin (nodules, ulcers), lungs, sinuses
- **Diagnosis (General Methods)**
  - Microscopy (Wet mount, Staining)
  - Culture (Non-nutrient agar + bacterial overlay)
  - PCR
  - Confocal Microscopy (for Keratitis)
  - Biopsy (GAE, skin lesions)
- **Treatment Principles**
  - Often challenging due to cyst resistance
  - Prolonged therapy required
- **Prevention**
  - Strict contact lens hygiene
  - Avoid tap water/non-sterile solutions with lenses
  - Avoid swimming/showering with lenses
