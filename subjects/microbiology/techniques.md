## Laboratory Techniques

### Nucleic Acid Techniques
- **PCR**
  - Components (Template, Primers, Polymerase, dNTPs, Buffer)
  - Steps (Denaturation, Annealing, Extension)
  - Types (qPCR - quantification, RT-PCR - RNA template)
  - Applications (Diagnosis, Cloning, Forensics)
- **Electrophoresis**
  - Agarose Gel (DNA/RNA separation by size)
  - Principle (Charge, Size)
- **Blotting**
  - Southern Blot (DNA detection)
  - Northern Blot (RNA detection)
  - Principle (Electrophoresis + Transfer + Hybridization + Detection)
- **Sequencing**
  - Sanger (Chain termination)
  - NGS (High-throughput, massively parallel)
- **Hybridization**
  - FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) - chromosome analysis, gene localization

### Protein Techniques
- **Electrophoresis**
  - SDS-PAGE (Protein separation by size after denaturation)
- **Blotting**
  - Western Blot (Protein detection)
  - Components (SDS-PAGE + Transfer + Antibody Detection)
  - Primary vs Secondary Antibody
- **ELISA** (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
  - Principle (Antigen/Antibody binding, enzyme conjugate, substrate)
  - Types (Direct, Indirect, Sandwich, Competitive)
  - Applications (Diagnosis - HIV, Hormones)
- **Chromatography**
  - Principle (Separation based on partitioning/adsorption)
  - Types (Gel Filtration, Ion Exchange, Affinity, HPLC)
- **Immunofluorescence / Immunohistochemistry**
  - Principle (Antibody labeled with fluorophore/enzyme)
  - Application (Protein localization in cells/tissues)

### Cellular Techniques
- **Flow Cytometry**
  - Principle (Cell suspension passes through laser, scattered/fluorescence light detected)
  - Analysis (Cell counting, phenotyping - using fluorescent antibodies)
  - FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting)
- **Microscopy**
  - Light Microscopy (Bright-field, Phase Contrast, Fluorescence)
  - Electron Microscopy (TEM, SEM)
  - Confocal Microscopy (Optical sectioning)
- **Cell Culture**
  - Principle (Growing cells outside body)
  - Applications (Research, Vaccine production)

### Genetic Engineering Basics
- **Restriction Enzymes**
  - Types (Type I, II, III)
  - Recognition sites (Palindromic)
  - Blunt vs Sticky ends
- **Vectors**
  - Role (Deliver foreign DNA into host)
  - Features (ORI, Selectable Marker, MCS - Multiple Cloning Site)
  - Types (Plasmids, Bacteriophages, Viral Vectors)
- **Recombinant DNA**
  - Principle (Joining DNA from different sources)
