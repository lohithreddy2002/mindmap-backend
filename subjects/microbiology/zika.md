## Zika Virus

### Overview
- Family: Flaviviridae
- Genus: Flavivirus
- Related to: Dengue, Yellow Fever, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis
- Discovered: Zika Forest, Uganda, 1947

### Epidemiology
- Primary vector: Aedes mosquitoes (A. aegypti, A. albopictus)
- Geographic Distribution: Tropical & subtropical regions (Americas, Africa, Asia, Pacific)
- Outbreaks: Major in Brazil (2015-2016), global spread

### Transmission
- **Mosquito bite** (most common)
- **Vertical Transmission**:
  - In utero (Congenital Zika Syndrome)
  - Perinatal
- **Sexual Transmission**: (Can persist in semen longer)
- Blood Transfusion (rare)
- Lab Exposure (rare)

### Clinical Features
- Often **Asymptomatic** (~80%)
- Symptomatic (mild, self-limiting):
  - **Fever** (low-grade)
  - **Rash** (maculopapular, pruritic) - Common buzzword
  - **Arthralgia** (joint pain) - Common buzzword
  - **Conjunctivitis** (non-purulent) - Common buzzword
  - Myalgia (muscle pain)
  - Headache
  - Fatigue

### Complications (High-Yield)
- **Neurological Complications**:
  - **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)** - Post-infectious - Common buzzword
  - Encephalitis, Meningitis, Myelitis (less common)
- **Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS)** - Vertical transmission key
  - **Microcephaly** (severe) - Hallmark buzzword
  - Brain abnormalities: Ventriculomegaly, Intracranial Calcifications (often periventricular), Cortical Malformations
  - **Ocular Abnormalities**: Macular scarring, Optic nerve hypoplasia, Microphthalmia
  - **Joint Contractures/Arthrogryposis**
  - Hearing loss
  - Growth restriction

### Diagnosis
- **RT-PCR**: Detects viral RNA (acute phase, <1-2 weeks)
  - Sample: Blood, urine, semen, amniotic fluid, CSF
  - **Urine** often positive longer than blood
- **Serology**: Detects IgM/IgG antibodies
  - IgM: Appear ~1 week after symptom onset, can persist for months
  - **Cross-reactivity** with other Flaviviruses (Dengue) is a challenge
  - **PRNT (Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test)**: Confirmatory, distinguishes between Flaviviruses, but complex and time-consuming

### Prevention & Management
- **Mosquito Control**: Vector control measures (eliminate breeding sites, insecticides)
- **Personal Protection**: Insect repellents, protective clothing, screens
- **Safe Sex**: Use condoms for several months if travel/exposure risk
- **Travel Advice**: Pregnant women should avoid travel to affected areas
- **Management**: Supportive care (fluids, rest, pain relief). No specific antiviral treatment.
- Monitoring for pregnant women with exposure/infection.
- Long-term support for infants with CZS.
