## Coccidioides immitis - INICET Cheat Sheet

### Microbiology
-   **Dimorphic Fungus**
    -   Mold in soil (25-30°C)
        -   Hyphae
        -   Arthroconidia (infectious form)
    -   Spherule in tissue (37°C)
        -   Thick-walled
        -   Contains Endospores
### Epidemiology
-   **Endemic Areas**
    -   Southwestern USA (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas)
    -   Northern Mexico
    -   Parts of Central & South America
-   **Transmission**
    -   Inhalation of arthroconidia from disturbed soil
### Clinical Manifestations
-   **Coccidioidomycosis ("Valley Fever")**
    -   **Primary Pulmonary**
        -   Often asymptomatic (60%)
        -   Symptomatic: Flu-like illness (fever, cough, chest pain, myalgias)
        -   Chest X-ray: Infiltrates, nodules, cavities
    -   **Disseminated** (Risk: Immunocompromised, Philippines, African American, Pregnant)
        -   Skin lesions (most common extrapulmonary)
        -   Bone/Joints (Osteomyelitis, Arthritis - "Desert Rheumatism")
        -   CNS (Meningitis - most serious form)
        -   Other organs (Liver, Spleen, Adrenals)
    -   **Immunologic Reactions**
        -   Erythema Nodosum (common, good prognosis)
        -   Erythema Multiforme
### Diagnosis
-   **Microscopy**
    -   Tissue biopsy/fluids: Spherules with endospores (KOH prep, H&E, GMS stains)
-   **Culture**
    -   Sputum, tissue, CSF
    -   Grows as mold
    -   **Hazardous (BSL-3)** - Arthroconidia easily aerosolized
-   **Serology**
    -   **IgM (Coccidioidal Antibody)**: Tube Precipitin (TP) or Immunodiffusion (ID-TP) - Acute infection (early)
    -   **IgG (Complement Fixation - CF)**: Complement Fixation (CF) or Immunodiffusion (ID-CF) - Chronic or disseminated disease, Titers correlate with severity/prognosis
-   **Molecular Methods**
    -   PCR (on respiratory samples, tissue, CSF)
### Treatment
-   **Mild/Moderate Pulmonary**
    -   Usually self-limiting (no treatment)
    -   Antifungals may be used if symptoms persist or for risk factors
-   **Severe Pulmonary or Disseminated**
    -   **Amphotericin B** (initial treatment for severe/life-threatening)
    -   **Azoles** (Fluconazole, Itraconazole) - Step-down therapy after Ampho B, or for less severe disseminated disease, long-term maintenance
-   **Meningitis**
    -   High-dose **Fluconazole** (Lifelong therapy often needed)
