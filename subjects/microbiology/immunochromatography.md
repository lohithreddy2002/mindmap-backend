## Immunochromatography (Lateral Flow Assay)

### Principle
- Capillary Action
- Antigen-Antibody Binding

### Components & Function
- Sample Pad: Receives sample
- Conjugate Pad: Contains labeled Ab or Ag (Gold nanoparticles, latex beads, etc.)
- Test Line: Immobilized capture Ab or Ag specific to analyte
- Control Line: Immobilized Ab or Ag that binds labeled conjugate, confirms test validity
- Absorbent Pad: Wicks away excess fluid

### Types & Interpretation
- **Sandwich Assay**
    - Detects: Antigens (larger molecules)
    - Mechanism: Sample antigen binds labeled Ab from conjugate pad, complex moves to test line and binds captured Ab.
    - Positive: Test Line + Control Line appear
    - Negative: Control Line appears only
- **Competitive Assay**
    - Detects: Small molecules / Haptens
    - Mechanism: Labeled analyte from conjugate pad competes with sample analyte for limited binding sites on captured Ab at test line.
    - Positive: Control Line appears only (Sample analyte blocked labeled analyte from binding test line)
    - Negative: Test Line + Control Line appear (Labeled analyte bound test line as sample analyte was absent or low)
- **Invalid Test:** Control Line absent

### Applications
- Pregnancy Tests (hCG)
- Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 Ag/Ab, Dengue, Malaria, HIV, Strep A)
- Drug Testing
- Cardiac Markers

### Pros & Cons
- **Advantages (POC)**
    - Rapid Results
    - Simple to Use
    - Cost-Effective
    - No Specialized Equipment
    - Stable at Room Temp
- **Disadvantages**
    - Lower Analytical Sensitivity / Specificity (vs ELISA, PCR)
    - Qualitative or Semi-Quantitative
    - Potential False Positives/Negatives
    - Hook Effect (High-dose phenomenon)
