## Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)

- ### Microbiology
  - Spirochete
  - Gram-negative (weakly staining)
  - Motile (corkscrew motion)
  - Cannot be cultured on artificial media (requires rabbit testis)
  - Visualized by Darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody (DFA)

- ### Transmission
  - Sexual contact (most common)
  - Congenital (vertical)
  - Blood transfusion (rare)

- ### Stages of Syphilis
  - #### Primary Syphilis
    - Incubation: 3-4 weeks
    - Painless chancre (usually single, firm, indurated ulcer)
    - Regional lymphadenopathy (non-tender)
    - Highly infectious

  - #### Secondary Syphilis
    - Disseminated stage
    - 2-10 weeks after chancre
    - Generalized rash (often palms and soles)
    - Condylomata lata (moist, warty lesions in moist areas)
    - Mucous patches (oral lesions)
    - Generalized lymphadenopathy
    - Alopecia (moth-eaten)
    - Constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise)
    - Highly infectious

  - #### Latent Syphilis
    - Asymptomatic
    - Early latent (< 1 year): Potentially infectious
    - Late latent (> 1 year): Non-infectious (except congenital)
    - Diagnosis based on serology

  - #### Tertiary Syphilis (Late Syphilis)
    - Occurs years to decades after primary infection
    - Non-infectious
    - Can affect any organ
    - #### Gummatous Syphilis
      - Granulomatous lesions (skin, bone, viscera)
    - #### Cardiovascular Syphilis
      - Aortitis (ascending aorta)
      - Aortic aneurysm
      - Aortic regurgitation
      - Coronary ostial stenosis
    - #### Neurosyphilis (Can occur at any stage, but often considered late)
      - Meningitis
      - Stroke (syphilitic arteritis)
      - Tabes Dorsalis (demyelination of dorsal columns, roots, ganglia)
        - Argyll Robertson pupil (accommodates but doesn't react to light)
        - Lightning pains
        - Sensory ataxia
        - Charcot joints
      - General Paresis (dementia, personality change, delusions)
      - Optic atrophy

- ### Congenital Syphilis
  - Transmission from mother to fetus
  - Severity depends on maternal stage and timing of treatment
  - #### Early congenital (< 2 years)
    - Rhinitis (snuffles)
    - Rash (vesiculobullous or maculopapular)
    - Hepatosplenomegaly
    - Jaundice
    - Anemia
    - Osteochondritis/Periostitis (pseudoparalysis of Parrot)
  - #### Late congenital (> 2 years)
    - Hutchinson's triad (Interstitial keratitis, Hutchinson's teeth, Eighth nerve deafness)
    - Saddle nose
    - Saber shins
    - Clutton's joints (symmetric joint effusion)
    - Mulberry molars
    - Frontal bossing

- ### Diagnosis
  - #### Non-Treponemal Tests (Screening)
    - Detect antibodies to cardiolipin (reagin)
    - VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory)
      - Can be qualitative/quantitative
      - Used for CSF testing in neurosyphilis
    - RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin)
      - Qualitative/quantitative
    - Toluidine Red Unheated Serum Test (TRUST)
    - Unheated Serum Reagin (USR)
    - May be false positive (pregnancy, autoimmune disease, other infections)
    - Titers reflect disease activity and response to treatment

  - #### Treponemal Tests (Confirmatory)
    - Detect antibodies specific to *T. pallidum* antigens
    - FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption)
      - Highly sensitive and specific
      - Usually remains positive for life
    - TPPA (Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination)
      - High sensitivity and specificity
      - Usually remains positive for life
    - EIA (Enzyme Immunoassay)
    - Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CIA)
    - Recombinant Treponemal Tests (multiplex flow assays)
    - Can be positive earlier than non-treponemal tests
    - Not used to monitor treatment response (remain positive)

  - #### Direct Detection
    - Darkfield microscopy (for chancres, condylomata lata)
    - DFA (Direct Fluorescent Antibody)
    - PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

  - #### Neurosyphilis Diagnosis
    - Requires CSF analysis
    - Positive CSF VDRL (highly specific)
    - Elevated CSF white blood cell count (> 5-10 cells/ÂµL)
    - Elevated CSF protein
    - Reactive serum treponemal test (essential prerequisite)

- ### Treatment
  - Drug of choice: Penicillin G
  - #### Primary, Secondary, Early Latent
    - Benzathine Penicillin G (single dose IM)
  - #### Late Latent, Tertiary
    - Benzathine Penicillin G (weekly IM for 3 weeks)
  - #### Neurosyphilis
    - Aqueous crystalline Penicillin G (IV for 10-14 days)
    - Alternative: Procaine Penicillin G (IM for 10-14 days) + Probenecid
  - #### Congenital Syphilis
    - Aqueous crystalline Penicillin G (IV for 10 days) or Procaine Penicillin G (IM for 10 days)
  - #### Penicillin Allergy
    - Desensitization for neurosyphilis, pregnancy, or severe allergy
    - Alternative: Doxycycline, Tetracycline (except in pregnancy/children)
    - Ceftriaxone can be used

- ### Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction
  - Acute febrile reaction within hours of starting syphilis treatment
  - Due to release of spirochete endotoxins
  - More common in early syphilis (high bacterial load)
  - Symptoms: Fever, chills, headache, myalgia, exacerbation of rash/lesions
  - Self-limiting, management is supportive (antipyretics)
  - Does not indicate drug allergy
