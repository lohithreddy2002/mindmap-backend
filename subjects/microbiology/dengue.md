# Dengue Fever

## Etiology & Virology
- **Virus:** Dengue Virus (DENV)
  - Family: Flaviviridae
  - Genus: Flavivirus
  - Type: RNA virus
- **Serotypes:**
  - DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4
  - **DENV-2** & **DENV-3** often associated with severe dengue
  - Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity **only to that serotype**
- **Transmission:**
  - Vector: Aedes mosquito (A. aegypti, A. albopictus)
  - **Diurnal biter**
  - Breeds in **clean water**
  - Human-mosquito-human cycle

## Pathophysiology
- **Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE)**:
  - Secondary infection with different serotype
  - Pre-existing non-neutralizing antibodies from prior infection
  - Enhances viral uptake by macrophages -> increased viral replication
- **Immune Response:**
  - Activation of T cells, mast cells, complement system
  - Release of cytokines & mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, Platelet Activating Factor)
- **Key Event:** **Increased vascular permeability**
  - Leading to **plasma leakage**
  - **Hallmark of severe dengue**
- **Hematological Changes:**
  - Thrombocytopenia (direct viral effect, immune mediated)
  - Hemoconcentration (due to plasma leakage -> increased Hct)

## Clinical Presentation
- **Phases:**
  - **Febrile Phase (Days 1-5/7):**
    - High fever (often sudden onset)
    - Headache (retro-orbital)
    - Myalgia, Arthralgia ("Breakbone fever")
    - Rash (maculopapular or petechial)
    - Nausea, Vomiting
    - Leukopenia
    - **NS1 antigen positive**
  - **Critical Phase (Days 3-7, as fever defervesces):**
    - **Plasma Leakage:**
      - Pleural effusion
      - Ascites
      - Edema
    - **Warning Signs:**
      - **Abdominal pain/tenderness**
      - **Persistent vomiting**
      - **Clinical fluid accumulation**
      - **Mucosal bleeding**
      - **Lethargy/restlessness**
      - **Liver enlargement (>2 cm)**
      - **Increasing Hct concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count**
    - **Severe Dengue:**
      - Severe plasma leakage (shock, fluid accumulation with respiratory distress)
        - **Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)**
      - Severe bleeding (hematemesis, melena)
      - Severe organ impairment (liver, heart, brain)
        - Elevated AST/ALT > 1000 U/L
        - Myocarditis
        - Encephalopathy
  - **Recovery Phase (Days 7-10):**
    - Gradual reabsorption of leaked fluid
    - Improved well-being
    - **Dengue rash (islands of white in a sea of red)**
    - Bradycardia possible
    - Platelet count usually starts to rise

## Diagnosis
- **Clinical Suspicion:** Based on fever, symptoms, and travel history to endemic area.
- **Laboratory Tests:**
  - **Febrile Phase (Early):**
    - **NS1 antigen** (high sensitivity in first 4-7 days)
    - **RT-PCR** (confirmatory, detects viral RNA)
  - **Late Febrile/Critical/Recovery Phase:**
    - **IgM anti-Dengue antibody** (appears from day 4-5, peaks at 2-3 weeks) - Primary infection
    - **IgG anti-Dengue antibody** (appears later than IgM, rises rapidly in secondary infection) - Secondary infection (IgG often positive at presentation)
  - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    - **Leukopenia** (common early finding)
    - **Thrombocytopenia** (<100,000/mm³)
    - **Rising Hematocrit (Hct)** (indicates plasma leakage)
- **Imaging:** Chest X-ray, Ultrasound (detect pleural effusion, ascites)

## Management
- **No specific antiviral treatment**
- **Supportive Care:**
  - Rest
  - Hydration (oral fluids if stable, IV fluids if warning signs or severe)
  - Paracetamol for fever/pain (Avoid Aspirin, NSAIDs due to bleeding risk)
- **Fluid Management (Crucial):**
  - **Monitor for warning signs & Hct/Platelet trend**
  - IV fluids (crystalloids) used cautiously if plasma leakage suspected/present
  - Goal: Maintain perfusion, avoid fluid overload
- **Monitoring:**
  - Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, SpO2)
  - Fluid intake/output
  - Hct and Platelet count (daily or more frequent in critical phase)
  - Watch for signs of shock or severe bleeding

## Prevention
- **Vector Control:**
  - Eliminate mosquito breeding sites (stagnant water)
  - Personal protection (repellents, long sleeves, screens)
  - Community awareness programs
- **Vaccine:**
  - **Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV):**
    - Live attenuated, tetravalent
    - Recommended only for individuals with **documented prior dengue infection** (risk of severe dengue in seronegatives after vaccination)
    - Approved by WHO for use in seropositive individuals aged 9-45 living in endemic areas.
  - Newer vaccines in development/use (e.g., Qdenga - TAK-003, approved for wider use)
