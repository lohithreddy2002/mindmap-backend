## Transfusion

### Blood Components
- **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**
  - Indications (Anemia, Acute blood loss)
  - Storage (4°C for 42 days in additive solutions)
  - Modified Components
    - Leukoreduced (Prevents FNHTR, CMV transmission)
    - Irradiated (Prevents TA-GVHD)
    - Washed (Prevents severe allergic reactions, IgA deficiency)
    - CMV Negative (Immunocompromised, Neonates)
- **Platelets**
  - Indications (Thrombocytopenia, Platelet dysfunction)
  - Storage (20-24°C with agitation for 5-7 days)
  - Types (Random Donor - RDP vs Single Donor - SDP)
- **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**
  - Indications (Multiple factor deficiencies, DIC, TTP, Warfarin reversal)
  - Storage (-18°C or colder for 1 year)
- **Cryoprecipitate**
  - Indications (Fibrinogen deficiency, Factor VIII deficiency, vWD, Factor XIII deficiency)
  - Components (Fibrinogen, Factor VIII, vWF, Factor XIII)
- **Albumin** (Volume expansion, Paracentesis)
- **IV Immunoglobulins (IVIg)** (ITP, Kawasaki, PID)
- **Granulocytes** (Neutropenia with sepsis unresponsive to antibiotics)

### Transfusion Reactions
- **Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (AHTR)**
  - Cause: ABO incompatibility
  - Features: Fever, chills, back pain, hemoglobinuria, hypotension, DIC
  - Management: Stop tx, IVF, Diuretics, Support BP/Renal function
- **Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR)**
  - Cause: Anamnestic response to non-ABO antibodies (Rh, Kidd, Duffy)
  - Features: Delayed drop in Hb (days to weeks), jaundice
- **Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)**
  - Cause: Cytokines released from donor WBCs
  - Features: Fever, chills within 4 hours (no hemolysis)
  - Prevention: Leukoreduction
- **Allergic Reaction**
  - Cause: Recipient antibodies to donor plasma proteins
  - Features: Urticaria, pruritus (mild), Bronchospasm, angioedema (severe)
  - Management: Antihistamines (mild), Epinephrine (severe)
- **Anaphylactic Reaction**
  - Cause: Anti-IgA antibodies in IgA deficient recipient
  - Features: Rapid onset, severe hypotension, shock, bronchospasm
  - Management: Epinephrine, IV fluids, Steroids. Use Washed RBCs.
- **TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury)**
  - Cause: Donor antibodies (HLA/HNA) reacting with recipient neutrophils
  - Features: Acute onset hypoxemia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, fever (within 6 hours)
- **TACO (Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload)**
  - Cause: Rate/volume of transfusion exceeds patient capacity
  - Features: Dyspnea, orthopnea, hypertension, pulmonary edema (within 6 hours)
  - Management: Stop tx, Diuretics, Respiratory support
- **Transfusion-Associated Graft-vs-Host Disease (TA-GVHD)**
  - Cause: Transfused donor lymphocytes engrafting in immunocompromised recipient
  - Features: Rash, fever, diarrhea, pancytopenia, liver dysfunction (days to weeks)
  - Prevention: Irradiation
- **Post-Transfusion Purpura (PTP)**
  - Cause: Antibodies (usually anti-HPA-1a) destroying recipient and donor platelets
  - Features: Severe thrombocytopenia 5-10 days post-transfusion

### Blood Group Systems & Pre-transfusion Testing
- **ABO System** (Naturally occurring antibodies)
- **Rh System** (D antigen, Immune antibodies)
- **Other Systems** (Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, Lewis)
- **Type and Screen** (ABO/Rh, Antibody screen for unexpected antibodies)
- **Crossmatching** (Major - Recipient serum + Donor RBCs)
- **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) / Direct Coombs Test** (Detects antibodies/complement on RBC surface - AIHA, HTR, HDN)
- **Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT) / Indirect Coombs Test** (Detects antibodies in serum - Antibody screen, Crossmatching, HDN workup)

### Transfusion Practice
- **Indications & Thresholds** (Hb for RBCs, Platelet count)
- **Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)**
  - Definition (e.g., >10 units RBC in 24h or >4 in 4h)
  - Goal: Prevent coagulopathy, acidosis, hypothermia
  - Ratio (Empirical balanced ratio e.g., 1:1:1 RBC:FFP:Platelets)
- **Transfusion in Special Populations**
  - Neonates (CMV-neg, Irradiated, Fresh blood <7 days)
  - Immunocompromised (Irradiated, Leukoreduced)
- **Alternatives** (Erythropoietin, Iron, TXA, Volume expanders)

### Donor Screening & Testing
- **Eligibility Criteria**
- **Infectious Disease Testing** (HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV, Syphilis, WNV, Trypanosoma cruzi)

### Storage Lesion
- Changes in RBCs over time (Decreased ATP, decreased 2,3-DPG -> left shift ODC, increased K, decreased pH, membrane changes)

### Therapeutic Apheresis
- **Plasmapheresis** (TTP, GBS, Myasthenia Gravis, Hyperviscosity)
- **Plateletpheresis** (Essential Thrombocythemia with high count)
- **Leukapheresis** (Leukostasis in AML)
- **Erythrocytapheresis** (Sickle Cell Disease - stroke prevention/acute crisis)

### INICET Buzzwords & High Yield
- Leukoreduction
- Irradiation
- Washed RBCs
- CMV Safe Blood
- TRALI vs TACO
- Febrile Reaction Workup (Rule out hemolysis/sepsis first)
- DAT Positive Conditions
- ABO Incompatibility (Most common cause of AHTR)
- IgA Deficiency (Risk for Anaphylaxis)
- Massive Transfusion Complications (Coagulopathy, Hypocalcemia, Hypothermia, Hyperkalemia)
- Rhogam (Prevention of Rh alloimmunization)
- Cold Agglutinins (Can interfere with testing)
- Rouleaux vs Agglutination
- Pre-storage vs Post-storage Leukoreduction
- Bedside Filtration (Obsolete)
- Febrile non-hemolytic reaction management (Antipyretics, consider leukoreduction for future)
