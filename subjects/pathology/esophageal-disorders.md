## Esophageal Disorders

-   **Motility Disorders**
    -   Achalasia
        -   Pathophysiology: Loss of inhibitory neurons (NO/VIP)
        -   Symptoms: Dysphagia (Solids & Liquids), Regurgitation (undigested food), Chest pain, Weight loss
        -   Diagnosis: Manometry (Absent peristalsis, High LES pressure), Barium Swallow (Bird's Beak)
        -   Treatment: POEM, Heller Myotomy, Pneumatic Dilation, Botox, CCB/Nitrates
    -   Diffuse Esophageal Spasm (DES)
        -   Symptoms: Intermittent Chest pain, Dysphagia
        -   Diagnosis: Barium Swallow (Corkscrew esophagus), Manometry (Simultaneous contractions)
        -   Treatment: PPI, CCB/Nitrates, Botox, Myotomy (rare)
    -   Nutcracker Esophagus (Hypertensive Peristalsis)
        -   Diagnosis: Manometry (High amplitude contractions)
        -   Symptoms: Chest pain, Dysphagia
        -   Treatment: PPI, CCB/Nitrates, TCA
    -   Scleroderma Esophagus
        -   Pathophysiology: Smooth muscle atrophy (distal 2/3)
        -   Diagnosis: Manometry (Low LES pressure, Absent distal peristalsis)
        -   Symptoms: Severe GERD, Dysphagia
        -   Treatment: PPI

-   **GERD & Complications**
    -   Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
        -   Pathophysiology: Impaired LES, Hiatal hernia, Delayed gastric emptying
        -   Symptoms: Heartburn, Regurgitation, Atypical (Cough, Hoarseness, Chest pain)
        -   Diagnosis: Clinical, PPI trial, Endoscopy, 24-hr pH/Impedance monitoring
        -   Treatment: Lifestyle mod, PPI, H2RA, Fundoplication
    -   Esophagitis (Reflux, Eosinophilic, Infectious)
    -   Peptic Stricture
        -   Cause: Chronic GERD
        -   Symptoms: Dysphagia (Solids > Liquids)
        -   Treatment: Dilation, PPI
    -   Barrett's Esophagus
        -   Definition: Metaplasia (Squamous to Intestinal)
        -   Risk Factor: Adenocarcinoma
        -   Diagnosis: Endoscopy + Biopsy (Intestinal metaplasia)
        -   Management: PPI, Surveillance Endoscopy, Endoscopic Eradication Therapy (EET) for Dysplasia (RFA, EMR)

-   **Esophageal Cancer**
    -   Types: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), Adenocarcinoma
    -   Risk Factors: SCC (Smoking, Alcohol, Caustic injury, Achalasia), Adenocarcinoma (Barrett's Esophagus, Obesity, GERD)
    -   Presentation: Progressive Dysphagia (Solids then Liquids), Weight loss, Odynophagia
    -   Diagnosis: Endoscopy + Biopsy, Staging (CT, PET, EUS)
    -   Treatment: Surgery, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy

-   **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)**
    -   Pathophysiology: Allergic/Immune-mediated
    -   Symptoms: Dysphagia, Food Impaction, Chest pain, Reflux symptoms refractory to PPI
    -   Diagnosis: Endoscopy (Rings, Furrows, Strictures, Edema, Exudates), Biopsy (>15 Eosinophils/HPF)
    -   Treatment: PPI, Diet Modification (6-food elimination), Swallowed Topical Steroids, Dilation

-   **Esophageal Varices**
    -   Cause: Portal Hypertension (Liver cirrhosis)
    -   Complication: Variceal Bleeding (Life-threatening)
    -   Management: Acute Bleed (Endoscopy - Banding/Sclerotherapy, Octreotide, Antibiotics), Prevention (Non-selective Beta-blockers, Banding)

-   **Diverticula**
    -   Zenker's (Pharyngoesophageal): Pulsion, above UES, Regurgitation (undigested food), Halitosis
    -   Midesophageal: Traction, often with Granulomatous disease
    -   Epiphrenic: Pulsion, above LES

-   **Structural Issues**
    -   Strictures (Peptic, Caustic, Eosinophilic, Anastomotic)
    -   Rings & Webs: Schatzki Ring (Lower esophagus, near GE junction, Intermittent dysphagia - Solids)

-   **Infections** (Immunocompromised patients)
    -   Candida Esophagitis: White plaques, Odynophagia, Tx: Fluconazole
    -   HSV Esophagitis: Multiple small ulcers, Tx: Acyclovir
    -   CMV Esophagitis: Large linear ulcers, Tx: Ganciclovir

-   **Caustic Injury**
    -   Agents: Alkali (Liquefactive necrosis), Acid (Coagulation necrosis)
    -   Evaluation: Early Endoscopy (within 12-24h)
    -   Complications: Perforation, Stricture formation
