## TB (Tuberculosis)

-   **Diagnosis**
    -   Clinical Suspicion (Cough > 2 weeks, Fever, Weight loss, Night sweats)
    -   Microscopy
        -   AFB Stain (Ziehl-Neelsen, Auramine-Rhodamine)
        -   Sputum (Morning sample)
    -   Culture (Gold Standard)
        -   Solid (LJ medium) - Slow
        -   Liquid (MGIT) - Faster
    -   Molecular Tests
        -   GeneXpert/CBNAAT (Rapid, Rifampicin resistance)
        -   Line Probe Assay (LPA)
    -   Immunological Tests
        -   Mantoux Test (TST) - PPD
            -   Interpretation (Induration size based on risk groups)
        -   IGRA (Interferon Gamma Release Assay)
            -   Quantiferon-TB Gold, T-SPOT.TB
            -   Less affected by BCG
    -   Imaging
        -   CXR (Apical/posterior segments upper lobes - Reactivation)
        -   CT Scan
    -   Histopathology (Caseating granuloma)
    -   Biopsy (Tissue, Lymph node)
    -   Fluid Analysis (Pleural, CSF, Ascitic) - ADA levels

-   **Treatment**
    -   DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course)
    -   First-line Drugs (RIPE)
        -   Rifampicin (R)
            -   Inducer, Orange secretions
        -   Isoniazid (H)
            -   Peripheral neuropathy (give Pyridoxine/B6)
        -   Pyrazinamide (Z)
            -   Hyperuricemia, Arthralgia
        -   Ethambutol (E)
            -   Optic Neuritis (Red-green colour blindness)
    -   Duration (Standard: 6 months)
    -   Regimens (Intensive vs Continuation phase)
    -   Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity, Rash, GI upset)
    -   Monitoring (Clinical, Smear conversion, Culture conversion)

-   **Latent TB Infection (LTBI)**
    -   Definition (Infection without active disease)
    -   Diagnosis (TST or IGRA positive)
    -   Treatment
        -   Indications (Contacts, Immunosuppressed, Fibrotic lesions on CXR)
        -   Regimens
            -   INH daily for 6-9 months
            -   Rifapentine + INH weekly for 3 months
            -   Rifampicin daily for 4 months

-   **Drug Resistance**
    -   MDR-TB (Multidrug-resistant)
        -   Resistant to at least INH + Rifampicin
    -   Pre-XDR TB (MDR + resistance to either Fluoroquinolone or Second-line injectable)
    -   XDR-TB (Extensively drug-resistant)
        -   Resistant to MDR + Fluoroquinolone + at least one Second-line injectable
    -   DST (Drug Sensitivity Testing)
        -   Phenotypic (Culture-based)
        -   Genotypic (Molecular - LPA, Sequencing)
    -   Treatment (Requires Second-line drugs, Longer duration, Complex regimens)

-   **Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB)**
    -   Lymph node TB (Scrofula - Cervical)
    -   Pleural TB (Exudative effusion, high ADA, lymphocytosis)
    -   Skeletal TB (Pott's spine - Vertebral, cold abscess)
    -   TB Meningitis (Most serious form, CSF findings - high protein, low glucose, lymphocytosis, high ADA)
    -   Abdominal TB (Peritoneum, Intestines, Nodes)
    -   Genitourinary TB (Sterile pyuria)
    -   Pericardial TB (Effusion, Constrictive pericarditis)
    -   Miliary TB (Disseminated, Millet seed appearance on CXR)
    -   Diagnosis (Site-specific samples, Biopsy, ADA)

-   **Special Populations**
    -   HIV Co-infection
        -   Diagnosis challenges
        -   IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome)
        -   Treatment modifications (Drug interactions with ART)
        -   IPT indications
    -   Children (Often EPTB, Primary complex, Different drug dosing)
    -   Pregnancy (Treatment generally safe, Streptomycin contraindicated)
