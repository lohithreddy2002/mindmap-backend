## Macrocytic Anemia (MCV > 100 fL)

### Classification
- **Megaloblastic**
  - Impaired DNA synthesis
  - Characterized by **megaloblasts** in bone marrow
  - Hypersegmented neutrophils (>= 5 lobes in >= 1 neutrophil or >= 3 lobes in >= 3 neutrophils)
- **Non-Megaloblastic**
  - Various other mechanisms
  - No megaloblasts in marrow (usually)
  - Round macro-ovalocytes (often)

  - **Impaired Transport/Metabolism:**
    - **Transcobalamin II deficiency** (rare)

  - Glossitis (smooth, beefy red tongue) - **HIGH YIELD**
  - Angular cheilitis
  - Mild Jaundice (ineffective erythropoiesis/intramedullary hemolysis)
  - **Neurological Symptoms:** - **HIGH YIELD** (specific to B12, due to impaired myelin synthesis)
    - Peripheral neuropathy (paresthesias, numbness)
    - Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord (SCDSC): Dorsal columns (proprioception, vibration) & Lateral columns (spastic paresis, hyperreflexia, Babinski) - **HIGH YIELD**
    - Dementia, Psychiatric symptoms
    - Optic atrophy
- **Diagnosis**
  - **CBC:** High MCV, low Hb, low Reticulocytes, Pancytopenia common
  - **Peripheral Smear:** **Macro-ovalocytes**, **Hypersegmented Neutrophils**, Anisocytosis, Poikilocytosis, Basophilic stippling, Howell-Jolly bodies (severe cases) - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Bone Marrow:** Megaloblastic changes (large precursors), Erythroid hyperplasia, Dysplasia - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Serum B12 Level:** Low
  - **Serum Folate Level:** Normal or High (often high if B12 deficient due to "folate trap")
  - **Serum Methylmalonic Acid (MMA):** **Elevated** in B12 deficiency - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Serum Homocysteine:** **Elevated** in BOTH B12 and Folate deficiency - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Intrinsic Factor Antibodies:** Positive in Pernicious Anemia (most specific) - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Parietal Cell Antibodies:** Positive in Pernicious Anemia (less specific)
  - **Schilling Test:** Historical, used to diagnose cause of B12 malabsorption (rarely done now)

#### Folate (Folic Acid) Deficiency
- **Causes**
  - **Decreased Intake:** Diet (lack of green leafy vegetables), Alcoholism, Poverty, Elderly, Fad diets
  - **Increased Requirement:** - **HIGH YIELD**
    - Pregnancy, Lactation
    - Chronic Hemolysis (Sickle cell, Thalassemia, AIHA)
    - Malignancy
    - Chronic Inflammatory Diseases (Crohn's, Rheumatoid Arthritis)
    - Extensive Skin Disorders (Psoriasis)
    - Dialysis
  - **Impaired Absorption:** Sprue, Celiac disease, Regional enteritis, Extensive jejunal resection
  - **Impaired Metabolism:**
    - Folic Acid Antagonists: **Methotrexate, Trimethoprim, Pyrimethamine** - **HIGH YIELD**
    - Other Drugs: Phenytoin, Barbiturates, Oral Contraceptives - **HIGH YIELD**
    - Alcohol
- **Clinical Features**
  - Anemia symptoms
  - Glossitis
  - **NO Neurological Symptoms** - Key difference from B12 deficiency - **HIGH YIELD**
- **Diagnosis**
  - **CBC/Peripheral Smear/Bone Marrow:** Similar to B12 deficiency (macro-ovalocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, megaloblastic marrow)
  - **Serum Folate Level:** Low (can fluctuate with diet)
  - **Red Cell Folate Level:** **Low** (better indicator of tissue stores, less affected by recent intake) - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Serum B12 Level:** Normal
  - **Serum MMA:** Normal - **HIGH YIELD**
  - **Serum Homocysteine:** **Elevated** - **HIGH YIELD**

### Non-Megaloblastic Anemia Causes

- **Alcohol Abuse:** Most common cause of non-megaloblastic macrocytosis - **HIGH YIELD** (direct toxic effect, nutritional deficiency)
- **Liver Disease:** Chronic liver disease (altered lipid composition of RBC membrane) - **HIGH YIELD** ("Target cells" may be present)
- **Hypothyroidism:** (Unclear mechanism, possibly affecting erythropoiesis or lipid metabolism)
- **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):** Bone marrow failure, dysplastic changes - **HIGH YIELD** (Often macrocytic, can have multi-lineage dysplasia)
- **Reticulocytosis:** High retic count (larger young RBCs) can mildly increase MCV (often normocytic with high RDW, but can be macrocytic)
- **Aplastic Anemia:** (Often normo or slightly macrocytic)
- **Multiple Myeloma / Plasma Cell Dyscrasias:** (Rare, rouleaux formation can affect automated counts)
- **Drugs:** Hydroxyurea, AZT (Zidovudine), Cytarabine - **HIGH YIELD** (DNA synthesis inhibitors, but typically classified as non-megaloblastic macrocytosis clinically unless specific megaloblastic changes are prominent)

### Diagnostic Approach

- **Confirm Macrocytosis:** Check MCV on CBC. Rule out spurious causes (hyperglycemia, marked leukocytosis).
- **Rule out Reticulocytosis:** Check Reticulocyte count.
- **Evaluate Peripheral Smear:** **Key step** - Look for macro-ovalocytes vs round macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils.
- **Check B12 and Folate Levels:** Serum B12, Serum Folate, Red Cell Folate.
- **Check MMA and Homocysteine:** Differentiates B12 vs Folate deficiency.
- **Investigate Specific Causes:**
  - B12: IF/Parietal cell antibodies, check for malabsorption causes (GI evaluation).
  - Folate: Diet, drugs, increased requirements.
  - Non-megaloblastic: Liver function tests, Thyroid function tests, Bone marrow biopsy (if MDS suspected).

### Treatment

- **B12 Deficiency:** Parenteral B12 (IM injections) initially, then oral/nasal/lower dose parenteral for life depending on cause (e.g., lifelong for Pernicious Anemia). **Monitor K+ levels** after starting treatment (due to rapid cell production).
- **Folate Deficiency:** Oral Folic Acid supplementation. Address underlying cause.
- **Non-Megaloblastic:** Treat underlying cause (e.g., stop alcohol, manage liver disease, treat hypothyroidism, manage MDS).
