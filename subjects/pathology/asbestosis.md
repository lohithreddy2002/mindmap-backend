# Asbestosis

## Definition
- Chronic lung disease
- Interstitial fibrosis due to asbestos inhalation

## Cause
- **Asbestos Exposure**
  - Occupational
    - Shipyard workers
    - Insulation installers
    - Miners
    - Construction workers
  - Environmental
  - **Types**
    - Crocidolite (Blue asbestos) - Highest risk for Mesothelioma
    - Amosite (Brown asbestos)
    - Chrysotile (White asbestos) - Most common globally, less risk for mesothelioma

## Pathology
- **Mechanism**
  - Fiber inhalation
  - Deposition in alveoli/bronchioles
  - Macrophage activation & Inflammation
  - Fibroblast proliferation -> Fibrosis
- **Location**
  - Primarily lower lobes
  - Subpleural regions
- **Hallmark**
  - **Asbestos Bodies (Ferruginous bodies)** - Iron-coated asbestos fibers

## Clinical Features
- **Latency Period**
  - Long (>10-20 years after initial exposure)
- **Symptoms**
  - Progressive Dyspnea (most common)
  - Dry cough
- **Signs**
  - Bibasilar fine crackles (velcro rales)
  - Clubbing

## Diagnosis
- **History**
  - Crucial: Detailed occupational & environmental exposure
- **Imaging**
  - **CXR**
    - Reticular/nodular pattern (esp lower zones)
    - Pleural plaques (most common manifestation, often calcified, parietal pleura)
    - Pleural thickening
  - **HRCT**
    - Subpleural curvilinear lines
    - Interlobular septal thickening
    - Honeycombing (late stage)
    - Ground glass opacity
    - Pleural changes (plaques, thickening)
- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT)**
  - **Restrictive pattern** (Reduced FVC, FEV1/FVC normal or increased)
  - Reduced DLCO (Impaired gas exchange)
- **Biopsy**
  - Rarely needed
  - Shows interstitial fibrosis and asbestos bodies
  - Transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy

## Complications / Associated Conditions (HIGH YIELD)
- **Pleural Plaques** (Benign, but indicate exposure)
- **Pleural Effusion**
- **Diffuse Pleural Thickening**
- **Malignancy**
  - **Bronchogenic Carcinoma** (Lung cancer)
    - Most common malignancy in asbestos workers
    - Strong synergism with smoking
  - **Mesothelioma**
    - Tumor of mesothelial cells (Pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, tunica vaginalis)
    - Highly specific to asbestos exposure (especially crocidolite)
    - Long latency (20-50 years)

## Management
- Supportive
- Oxygen therapy
- Pulmonary rehabilitation
- Management of complications
- No specific treatment to reverse fibrosis

## Prognosis
- Progressive disease
- Increased morbidity & mortality from respiratory failure and malignancy
