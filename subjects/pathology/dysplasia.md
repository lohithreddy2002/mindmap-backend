 ## Dysplasia

 - **Definition**
    - Disordered cellular growth & maturation
    - Atypical cellular changes
    - Architectural disorganization
    - Precursor to malignancy (usually)
    - Potentially reversible (especially low-grade)

 - **Key Features**
    - Cellular Atypia
       - Nuclear pleomorphism & hyperchromasia
       - Increased N:C ratio
       - Prominent nucleoli
       - Disordered chromatin
    - Architectural Changes
       - Loss of polarity/orientation
       - Disorganized differentiation
       - Increased mitotic figures (often abnormal location)

 - **Grading**
    - Based on extent of epithelial thickness involvement
    - Mild Dysplasia
       - Atypia limited to lower 1/3 of epithelium
    - Moderate Dysplasia
       - Atypia extends up to lower 2/3 of epithelium
    - Severe Dysplasia / Carcinoma In Situ (CIS)
       - Atypia involves nearly full thickness (severe) or full thickness (CIS) of epithelium
       - Basement membrane is intact (no invasion)
       - CIS is often considered synonymous with High-Grade Dysplasia

 - **Distinction from other terms**
    - vs Hyperplasia
       - Increased number of cells
       - Orderly growth pattern
       - Minimal/no atypia
    - vs Metaplasia
       - Replacement by different mature cell type
       - Orderly growth pattern
       - Minimal/no atypia (unless dysplasia supervenes)
    - vs Neoplasia (Invasive Carcinoma)
       - Irreversible
       - Breaks basement membrane (invasion)
       - Capacity for metastasis

 - **Common Sites & Examples (INICET Focus)**
    - Cervix
       - Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN I, II, III)
       - Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL, HSIL)
       - HPV infection is major risk factor
    - Esophagus
       - Barrett's Esophagus (Intestinal Metaplasia + Dysplasia)
       - Precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma
    - Colon
       - Adenoma (Tubular, Villous, Tubulovillous)
       - Adenoma-carcinoma sequence
    - Oral Cavity
       - Leukoplakia / Erythroplakia (Clinical terms)
       - Histology shows hyperplasia +/- dysplasia
    - Skin
       - Actinic Keratosis
       - Precursor to squamous cell carcinoma
    - Bladder
       - Papillary Urothelial Dysplasia
       - Flat Urothelial Carcinoma in Situ

 - **Significance & Fate**
    - Precursor lesion
    - Risk of progression to invasive carcinoma increases with grade (Mild < Mod < Severe/CIS)
    - Can regress (especially low-grade)
    - Treatment depends on site and grade

 - **INICET Buzzwords**
    - Disordered growth
    - Atypia (nuclear)
    - N:C ratio
    - Loss of polarity
    - Mitotic figures (upper layers)
    - CIS
    - CIN (I, II, III)
    - SIL (LSIL, HSIL)
    - Barrett's
    - Intestinal metaplasia
    - Adenoma
    - Actinic Keratosis
    - Basement membrane intact
