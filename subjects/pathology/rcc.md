## Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

### Epidemiology & Risk Factors
- Age (50-70)
- Male > Female
- **Smoking** (Most common modifiable risk)
- Obesity
- Hypertension
- Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease (Long-term dialysis)
- Genetics / Syndromes

### Pathology & Subtypes
- **Clear Cell (ccRCC)**
    - **Most Common (75%)**
    - Origin: Proximal tubule
    - **VHL mutation** (common)
    - Variable prognosis
- **Papillary (pRCC)**
    - 10-15%
    - Origin: Proximal tubule
    - Type 1 (MET mutation, generally better prognosis)
    - Type 2 (often FH mutation, generally worse prognosis)
- **Chromophobe**
    - 5%
    - Origin: Intercalated cells of collecting duct
    - **Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome** association
    - Generally good prognosis
- Oncocytoma
    - Benign (Distinguish from Chromophobe)
    - Central scar, Spoken wheel angiography
- Collecting Duct Carcinoma
    - Rare (<1%)
    - Origin: Medullary collecting ducts
    - Aggressive, Poor prognosis
- **Fuhrman Grade / ISUP Grade** (Nuclear grading, important prognostic factor)

### Clinical Presentation
- **Incidentaloma** (Most common presentation in modern era due to imaging)
- **Classical Triad** (Present in <10%, indicates advanced disease):
    - **Hematuria**
    - **Flank Pain**
    - **Palpable Abdominal Mass**
- Symptoms from Metastasis (Cough, bone pain, neurological)
- **Paraneoplastic Syndromes** (Occur in ~30%)
    - **Erythrocytosis** (EPO production)
    - **Hypercalcemia** (PTHrP production)
    - Hypertension (Renin production)
    - **Stauffer Syndrome** (Reversible Hepatic Dysfunction - elevated LFTs, hepatosplenomegaly, no hepatic mets)
    - Fever
    - Cachexia
    - Amyloidosis

### Diagnosis & Staging
- **Imaging:**
    - Ultrasound (Initial screen)
    - **CT Scan (Triphasic: non-contrast, arterial, venous)** - Modality of choice for characterization and staging
    - MRI (Useful if contrast contraindicated, or for vena cava involvement)
- Role of Biopsy:
    - Not always needed for classic enhancing renal masses planned for surgery.
    - Useful for small masses, atypical lesions, planning systemic therapy, suspected metastases.
- Staging Workup: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis. Bone scan/Brain MRI only if symptomatic or high risk features.
- **TNM Staging:** (Most important prognostic factor)
    - T Stage: Tumor size and local invasion
    - N Stage: Regional Lymph Nodes
    - M Stage: Distant Metastasis

### Prognosis
- **TNM Stage** (Most important)
- **Fuhrman/ISUP Grade**
- Histologic subtype (ccRCC > pRCC > Chromophobe usually in terms of aggressiveness)
- Performance Status
- Sarcomatoid differentiation (Poor prognosis)

### Management
- **Localized Disease (Stage I-II)**
    - **Surgery:**
        - **Partial Nephrectomy:** Standard of care for T1 tumors (<7cm), preserves renal function.
        - Radical Nephrectomy: Removal of entire kidney, indicated for larger/complex T1/T2 tumors or if partial not feasible.
    - Ablation (RFA, Cryoablation): For small (<3cm), peripheral tumors in selected patients (elderly, comorbidities, solitary kidney).
- **Locally Advanced Disease (Stage III)**
    - Radical Nephrectomy +/- Lymphadenectomy
    - Adjuvant Therapy (e.g., Pembrolizumab for high-risk ccRCC post-surgery)
- **Metastatic Disease (Stage IV)**
    - **Cytoreductive Nephrectomy:** Role debated, considered in selected patients with good performance status and limited metastases, often before systemic therapy.
    - **Systemic Therapy:**
        - **Targeted Therapy:**
            - **VEGF Pathway Inhibitors:** Sunitinib, Pazopanib, Axitinib, Bevacizumab (with IFN), Lenvatinib. Target angiogenesis.
            - **mTOR Inhibitors:** Temsirolimus, Everolimus. Target cell growth/proliferation.
        - **Immunotherapy:**
            - **PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors:** Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab. Block immune checkpoints.
            - **CTLA-4 Inhibitors:** Ipilimumab. Block immune checkpoints.
        - **Combinations:**
            - **IO+IO:** Nivolumab + Ipilimumab
            - **IO+TKI:** Pembrolizumab + Axitinib, Nivolumab + Cabozantinib, Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab, Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab. (Often preferred first-line regimens).
    - Metastasis-Directed Therapy (Surgery, Radiation) for limited metastatic sites.

### Genetics & Syndromes
- **VHL Syndrome:** Associated with **Clear Cell RCC** (most common familial form), pheochromocytoma, hemangioblastoma.
- Hereditary Papillary RCC: Associated with **MET gene** mutations, Type 1 Papillary RCC.
- **Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome:** Associated with **FLCN gene** mutations, Chromophobe RCC, Oncocytoma, hybrid tumors, lung cysts, skin fibrofolliculomas.
- Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and RCC: Associated with **FH gene** mutations, Type 2 Papillary RCC, cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas.
- Succinate Dehydrogenase Deficient RCC: Associated with SDHA/B/C/D gene mutations.
