## Pharmacokinetics (PK)
- **What body does to the drug**
- **ADME**
  - **Absorption**
    - Routes of Administration (Oral, IV, IM, SC, Sublingual, Rectal, Inhalation, Topical, Transdermal)
    - Factors Affecting Absorption (Lipid solubility, Ionization, Surface area, Blood flow, pH, Food)
    - **Bioavailability**
      - Definition (Fraction reaching systemic circulation)
      - Formula (AUC oral / AUC IV)
      - **First-Pass Metabolism** (Liver, Gut wall)
  - **Distribution**
    - **Volume of Distribution (Vd)**
      - Definition (Apparent volume drug distributes in)
      - Formula (Dose / Plasma Concentration)
      - Factors Affecting Vd (Protein binding, Tissue binding, Body water compartments)
    - **Protein Binding** (Albumin, Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein)
      - Significance (Bound inactive, drug interactions)
    - Barriers (Blood-brain barrier, Placental barrier)
  - **Metabolism (Biotransformation)**
    - Sites (Liver - primary, Kidney, Lung, GI tract)
    - Phases
      - Phase I (Oxidation, Reduction, Hydrolysis) - CYP450 enzymes
      - Phase II (Conjugation - Glucuronidation, Acetylation, Sulfation) - More polar, excretable
    - Factors Affecting Metabolism (Genetics, Age, Disease, Drug interactions - Induction/Inhibition)
  - **Excretion**
    - Routes (Kidney - primary, Biliary/Feces, Lung, Sweat, Milk)
    - **Renal Excretion**
      - Processes (Glomerular filtration, Tubular secretion, Tubular reabsorption)
      - Factors (GFR, Protein binding, Urine pH, Active transport)
    - **Clearance (Cl)**
      - Definition (Volume of plasma cleared per unit time)
      - Formula (Rate of elimination / Plasma concentration)
      - Organ Clearance (Renal, Hepatic)
- **Pharmacokinetic Parameters**
  - **Half-life (t1/2)**
    - Formula (0.693 * Vd / Cl)
    - Time to steady state (Approx. 4-5 t1/2)
    - Time for elimination (Approx. 4-5 t1/2)
  - **Steady State** (Rate of administration = Rate of elimination)
  - **Kinetics**
    - **First-order** (Rate proportional to concentration, constant t1/2) - Most drugs
    - **Zero-order** (Rate independent of concentration, variable t1/2, saturable) - E.g., Ethanol, Phenytoin, Aspirin (high dose)

## Pharmacodynamics (PD)
- **What drug does to the body**
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA)**
  - **Receptor Interactions**
    - **Agonists**
      - Full (Maximal effect)
      - Partial (Submaximal effect)
      - Inverse (Stabilize inactive receptor, decrease basal activity)
    - **Antagonists**
      - Competitive (Bind reversible at active site, surmountable by high agonist concentration) - Shifts dose-response curve Right
      - Non-Competitive (Bind irreversible at active site OR allosteric site, non-surmountable) - Decreases Emax
      - Chemical (Inactivate drug)
      - Physiological (Opposite effect via different pathway)
    - **Receptor Types**
      - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
      - Enzyme-linked receptors (Tyrosine kinase)
      - Ion channel receptors (Ligand-gated)
      - Intracellular receptors (Steroid hormones)
  - **Non-receptor Mechanisms** (Enzyme inhibition, Ion channels - voltage gated, Transport systems, Chemical reactions)
- **Dose-Response Relationships**
  - **Graded Dose-Response** (Response of a single system/tissue to increasing dose)
    - **Potency** (Dose required for a given effect, EC50)
    - **Efficacy (Emax)** (Maximal effect drug can produce)
  - **Quantal Dose-Response** (Response of a population to increasing dose - all or none)
    - **ED50** (Dose for desired effect in 50% population)
    - **TD50** (Dose for toxic effect in 50% population)
    - **LD50** (Dose for lethal effect in 50% population)
    - **Therapeutic Index (TI)**
      - Formula (TD50 / ED50 or LD50 / ED50)
      - Margin of safety (Larger TI = Safer drug)
    - **Therapeutic Window** (Range between minimal effective dose and minimal toxic dose)
- **Drug Interactions**
  - **Synergism** (Combined effect > sum of individual effects)
  - **Potentiation** (Drug A enhances effect of Drug B, Drug A has no effect alone)
  - **Additivity** (Combined effect = sum of individual effects)
  - **Antagonism** (Drug A reduces effect of Drug B)
- **Variability in Response**
  - Tolerance (Tachyphylaxis - acute, rapid tolerance)
  - Desensitization/Downregulation
  - Hypersensitivity/Supersensitivity
  - Genetic factors (Pharmacogenetics)
  - Age, Sex, Disease state, Environmental factors
