## Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade (NMB)
- Methods
  - Spontaneous Recovery
    - Time dependent
    - Dose dependent
  - Pharmacological Reversal
    - Aims for faster, more complete recovery
    - Essential to prevent PONDP
- Pharmacological Agents
  - Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Indirect)
    - Mechanism: Increase Acetylcholine (ACh) at NMJ
    - Compete with NMB for receptors
    - Require functional NMJ & sufficient ACh release
    - Co-administration with Anticholinergic essential
    - Neostigmine
      - Most common
      - Dose: 0.03-0.07 mg/kg (Max 5mg)
      - Onset: 5-10 mins
      - Duration: 30-60 mins
      - Co-admin: Anticholinergic (Glycopyrrolate or Atropine)
        - Glycopyrrolate: Preferred (less CNS/cardia effects, longer acting match)
        - Atropine: Faster onset, more tachycardia, crosses BBB
      - Side Effects: Muscarinic effects (Bradycardia, Salivation, Bronchorrhea, Miosis, Increased GI motility)
      - Limitations: Ceiling effect, ineffective in very deep block (TOF 0), not for Succinylcholine
    - Pyridostigmine
      - Longer acting than Neostigmine
      - Less common for routine reversal
    - Edrophonium
      - Shorter acting, faster onset than Neostigmine
      - Less potent muscarinic effects but still needs anticholinergic
      - Less common now
  - Selective Relaxant Binding Agent (Direct)
    - Sugammadex
      - Mechanism: Encapsulation (Cyclodextrin molecule)
      - Forms water-soluble complex, removes NMB from plasma
      - Indications: **Rocuronium**, **Vecuronium** (Steroidal NMBs)
      - Advantages: Rapid, predictable, complete reversal (even deep block), less side effects (no muscarinic effects), bypasses ACh system
      - Disadvantages: Cost, **Anaphylaxis** risk, Drug Interactions (e.g., decreases efficacy of **Hormonal Contraceptives**), Renal excretion
      - Dose: Varies with depth of block (e.g., 2 mg/kg for TOF 2+, 4 mg/kg for PTC 1-2, 16 mg/kg for immediate post-induction reversal of Roc)
- Monitoring Neuromuscular Blockade
  - Peripheral Nerve Stimulator
  - Common Modes:
    - Train-of-Four (TOF): 4 stimuli, count twitches (0-4)
    - Post-Tetanic Count (PTC): Tetanus followed by single stimuli, count responses
    - Double Burst Stimulation (DBS)
  - Adequate Reversal Criterion: **TOF Ratio > 0.9** (Gold standard)
- Clinical Signs of Adequate Reversal (Checklist)
  - Sustained Head Lift > 5 seconds
  - Strong Hand Grip
  - Vital Capacity > 20 ml/kg
  - Negative Inspiratory Force > -25 cmH2O
  - Opens eyes wide on command
  - Protrudes tongue
- Complications
  - **Postoperative Residual Neuromuscular Blockade (PONDP)**
    - TOF Ratio < 0.9 in PACU
    - Can lead to respiratory complications, re-intubation, increased hospital stay
    - Management: Re-reverse if block persists (check TOF)
  - Reversal in Special Populations (e.g., Myasthenia Gravis - caution with AChE inhibitors)
- INICET Buzzwords
  - **TOF Ratio > 0.9**
  - **Sugammadex** (Rocuronium, Vecuronium, **Cyclodextrin**, **Anaphylaxis**, **Hormonal Contraceptives**)
  - **Neostigmine** (Glycopyrrolate, Muscarinic Side Effects, Ceiling Effect)
  - **PONDP**
  - **Head Lift > 5s**
  - **Pseudocholinesterase deficiency** (Prolonged Succinylcholine/Mivacurium)
