 ## Enzyme Inducers & Inhibitors

 - ## Enzyme Induction
   - ↑ Enzyme Synthesis (CYP450)
   - Mechanism: Gene Upregulation
   - **Clinical Effect:**
     - ↓ Substrate Drug Levels
     - ↓ Therapeutic Effect (Failure)
     - Prodrugs: ↑ Active Metabolite (Potentially Toxicity)
   - **Key Inducers (High Yield):**
     - Rifampin
     - Phenytoin
     - Carbamazepine
     - Phenobarbital
     - St. John's Wort
     - Griseofulvin
     - Smoking (PAHs)
     - Chronic Alcohol Use
   - **Time Course:** Slow onset & offset (days to weeks)

 - ## Enzyme Inhibition
   - ↓ Enzyme Activity
   - Mechanism: Competitive, Non-Competitive, Irreversible
   - **Clinical Effect:**
     - ↑ Substrate Drug Levels
     - ↑ Risk of Toxicity / Side Effects
     - Prodrugs: ↓ Active Metabolite (Lack of Efficacy)
   - **Key Inhibitors (High Yield):**
     - Grapefruit Juice (CYP3A4)
     - Ketoconazole / Itraconazole
     - Erythromycin / Clarithromycin
     - Cimetidine
     - Ritonavir / Other PIs
     - Valproic Acid
     - Acute Alcohol Intake
     - Isoniazid
     - Omeprazole / Esomeprazole
     - Fluconazole
     - Amiodarone
     - Verapamil / Diltiazem
   - **Time Course:** Rapid onset & offset (hours to days)

 - ## Clinical Significance
   - Major Cause of Drug-Drug Interactions
   - Need for Dose Adjustment of Substrate Drugs
   - Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) often required

 - ## Important CYP450 Enzymes Affected
   - CYP3A4 (Most prevalent, affected by many inducers/inhibitors)
   - CYP2D6 (Genetic polymorphism, many substrates)
   - CYP2C9 (Warfarin, Phenytoin)
   - CYP2C19 (Clopidogrel, PPIs)
