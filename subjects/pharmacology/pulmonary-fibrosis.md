## Pulmonary Fibrosis
- Definition
- Etiology
  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
    - Most common
    - Progressive, chronic
    - Specific form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia
  - Secondary Causes
    - Connective Tissue Diseases (CTD-ILD)
      - Scleroderma
      - Rheumatoid Arthritis
      - Myositis
    - Occupational Exposures
      - Asbestosis
      - Silicosis
      - Coal Worker's Pneumoconiosis
    - Drug-Induced
      - Amiodarone
      - Methotrexate
      - Nitrofurantoin
      - Bleomycin
    - Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (Chronic)
    - Sarcoidosis
- Pathophysiology
  - Alveolar epithelial injury
  - Aberrant repair process
  - Fibroblast proliferation
  - Excessive collagen deposition
- Clinical Features
  - Symptoms
    - Progressive dyspnea on exertion
    - Dry, hacking cough
    - Fatigue
  - Signs
    - Bibasal inspiratory crackles ("Velcro" crackles)
    - Clubbing
    - Cyanosis (late)
- Diagnosis
  - History & Physical Exam
  - Imaging (HRCT Chest)
    - Key role in diagnosis, especially IPF
    - UIP Pattern (Usual Interstitial Pneumonia)
      - Basal and subpleural predominance
      - Reticular opacities
      - Honeycombing (essential for definite UIP pattern on HRCT)
      - Traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis
      - Absence of features against UIP (e.g., ground glass, cysts, nodules)
    - Other patterns (NSIP, HP, etc.)
  - Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)
    - Restrictive Pattern
      - Reduced FVC
      - Reduced TLC
      - Normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio
    - Reduced DLCO (Diffusion Capacity of Lung for Carbon Monoxide)
  - Serology
    - Rule out CTD-ILD
  - Bronchoscopy/BAL
    - Rule out infection, HP, malignancy
    - Limited role in IPF diagnosis
  - Surgical Lung Biopsy
    - Considered when HRCT pattern is equivocal or inconsistent
    - Histological UIP pattern: Spatiotemporal heterogeneity, fibroblast foci, honeycombing
  - Multidisciplinary Discussion (MDD)
    - Essential for diagnosis, especially IPF
- Management
  - General
    - Smoking cessation
    - Pulmonary rehabilitation
    - Oxygen therapy
    - Vaccinations
  - Pharmacological (for IPF)
    - Antifibrotic Agents
      - Pirfenidone
      - Nintedanib
      - Slow decline in FVC
      - Do not reverse fibrosis
    - No role for corticosteroids or immunosuppressants in IPF
  - Lung Transplantation
    - Option for eligible patients
- Prognosis
  - Variable depending on cause
  - IPF has poor prognosis (median survival 3-5 years without transplant)
- Complications
  - Pulmonary Hypertension
  - Acute Exacerbations
  - Respiratory Failure
  - Lung Cancer
