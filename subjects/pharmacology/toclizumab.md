## Tocilizumab (IL-6 Receptor Inhibitor)

-   **Mechanism**
    -   Monoclonal Antibody
    -   Targets & Blocks IL-6 Receptor (soluble & membrane-bound)
    -   Inhibits IL-6 signaling

-   **Indications**
    -   **Rheumatology**
        -   Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) - Moderate to severe, active
        -   Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA)
        -   Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (PJIA)
        -   Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
    -   **Oncology/Hematology**
        -   Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) - Post CAR T-cell therapy
    -   **Infectious Disease**
        -   Severe/Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia (in hospitalized adults, with systemic corticosteroids)

-   **Adverse Effects**
    -   **Infections**
        -   Increased risk (bacterial, viral, fungal, opportunistic)
        -   Requires TB screening before initiation
    -   **Hematologic**
        -   Neutropenia
        -   Thrombocytopenia
    -   **Hepatic**
        -   Elevated Liver Enzymes (ALT/AST)
    -   **Gastrointestinal**
        -   GI Perforation (Important Buzzword) - Higher risk in diverticulitis history
    -   **Lipid Profile**
        -   Dyslipidemia (Increased Cholesterol, Triglycerides)
    -   **Hypersensitivity Reactions**
        -   Infusion reactions, Anaphylaxis
    -   **Other**
        -   Hypertension
        -   Headache

-   **Monitoring**
    -   **Baseline**
        -   CBC (Neutrophils, Platelets)
        -   LFTs (ALT/AST)
        -   Lipid Panel
        -   TB Screening (PPD/IGRA)
        -   Hepatitis B/C screening
    -   **During Therapy**
        -   CBC, LFTs (regularly, esp. early)
        -   Monitor for signs of infection, GI symptoms

-   **INICET Buzzwords**
    -   IL-6
    -   IL-6 Receptor Blocker
    -   Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)
    -   CAR T-cell Therapy
