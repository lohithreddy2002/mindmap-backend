## Opioids & Withdrawal
- ## Mechanism
  - Receptors
    - Mu (μ) - Analgesia (Supraspinal, Spinal), Respiratory Depression, Euphoria, Physical Dependence, Miosis, ↓GI Motility
    - Kappa (κ) - Analgesia (Spinal), Sedation, Dysphoria, Miosis
    - Delta (δ) - Analgesia (Spinal), Antidepressant effects
  - Action
    - Gi/Go Protein Coupled Receptors
    - Pre-synaptic: ↓ Ca++ influx -> ↓ Neurotransmitter release
    - Post-synaptic: ↑ K+ efflux -> Hyperpolarization -> ↓ Neuronal Excitability
- ## Classification
  - Agonists
    - Full Agonists: Morphine, Fentanyl, Codeine, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Meperidine, Methadone, Heroin
    - Partial Agonists: Buprenorphine
  - Mixed Agonist/Antagonists
    - Nalbuphine (κ agonist, μ antagonist)
    - Pentazocine (κ agonist, weak μ partial agonist/antagonist)
  - Antagonists
    - Naloxone (Pure antagonist, short duration)
    - Naltrexone (Pure antagonist, long duration, oral/injectable)
- ## Pharmacokinetics
  - Metabolism: Primarily Hepatic (CYP enzymes, Glucuronidation)
    - Morphine -> Morphine-6-Glucuronide (M6G - Active, potent), Morphine-3-Glucuronide (M3G - Neuroexcitatory)
    - Codeine -> Morphine (CYP2D6 - Polymorphism)
    - Meperidine -> Normeperidine (Neurotoxic metabolite - Seizures)
    - Fentanyl: CYP3A4
    - Methadone: Long half-life (Variable, accumulation), CYP3A4
- ## Pharmacological Effects
  - CNS
    - Analgesia
    - Euphoria/Dysphoria
    - Sedation
    - Miosis (Pinpoint Pupils) - Except Meperidine (mydriasis)
    - Cough Suppression
    - Nausea/Vomiting (CTZ stimulation)
  - Respiratory System
    - Respiratory Depression (Dose-dependent, most serious ADR) - ↓ Sensitivity of respiratory center to CO2
  - Cardiovascular System
    - Orthostatic Hypotension (Histamine release, Vasodilation)
    - Bradycardia
  - Gastrointestinal System
    - Constipation (Increased tone, ↓ motility) - NO TOLERANCE develops
    - Biliary Spasm
  - Other
    - Pruritus (Histamine release)
    - Urinary Retention
    - Endocrine: Suppress GnRH, LH, FSH -> Hypogonadism (Chronic use)
- ## Key Drugs & Features
  - **Morphine:** Prototype, M6G active metabolite, histamine release, renal excretion of active metabolites (Caution in renal failure).
  - **Fentanyl:** High potency, short duration, Transdermal patch (Chronic pain), IV (Anesthesia).
  - **Meperidine (Pethidine):** Shorter duration, Muscarinic effects (Mydriasis, Tachycardia), Neurotoxicity (Normeperidine), Serotonin Syndrome risk. Avoid in renal failure, elderly, concurrent MAOIs.
  - **Methadone:** Long half-life, Used for chronic pain & Opioid Dependence Treatment (ODT), NMDA antagonist activity, QT prolongation risk.
  - **Buprenorphine:** Partial μ agonist, κ antagonist. Ceiling effect for respiratory depression. Used for pain & ODT. Can precipitate withdrawal in full agonist users.
  - **Tramadol:** Weak μ agonist, Inhibits NE & 5-HT reuptake. Seizure risk (lower seizure threshold), Serotonin Syndrome.
  - **Naloxone:** Pure opioid antagonist, Reverses opioid effects rapidly. Short duration (repeat dosing often needed in overdose).
  - **Naltrexone:** Pure opioid antagonist, Long duration. Used for ODT (maintains opioid-free state) & Alcohol Dependence.
- ## Toxicity (Overdose)
  - **Classic Triad:**
    1.  Coma
    2.  Miosis (Pinpoint pupils - except Meperidine)
    3.  Respiratory Depression
  - Management:
    - Airway support & Ventilation
    - Naloxone administration (IV, IM, IN) - Titrate to reverse respiratory depression, not necessarily wakefulness. Monitor closely for re-narcotization.
- ## Withdrawal Syndrome
  - Symptoms: NOT LIFE THREATENING (vs. Alcohol/Benzodiazepine withdrawal)
    - Autonomic Hyperactivity & CNS Excitation
    - Early (6-12 hrs, Peak 36-72 hrs): Yawning, Lacrimation, Rhinorrhea, Sweating, Restlessness, Anxiety, Muscle Aches.
    - Late (Peak continues, subside over 5-10 days): Piloerection (Goosebumps), Abdominal Cramps, Diarrhea, Nausea/Vomiting, Mydriasis, Tachycardia, Hypertension, Insomnia, Anorexia, Muscle Spasms.
  - Severity: Depends on half-life of opioid (shorter half-life -> faster, more intense; longer half-life -> slower onset, protracted, less intense).
- ## Management (Withdrawal & Dependence)
  - Withdrawal Symptom Management:
    - Clonidine (Alpha-2 agonist) - Reduces autonomic symptoms (BP, HR, sweating, diarrhea, anxiety).
    - NSAIDs/Acetaminophen (Muscle aches)
    - Antidiarrheals (Loperamide)
    - Antiemetics
  - Detoxification (Medically Supervised Withdrawal):
    - Gradual Taper of Methadone or Buprenorphine
  - Maintenance Treatment (Opioid Dependence Treatment - ODT/MAT):
    - Methadone (Full agonist, prevents withdrawal, reduces craving, blocked illicit opioid effects) - Regulated clinic setting.
    - Buprenorphine (Partial agonist, safer in overdose, less sedation than methadone, office-based treatment possible) - Often combined with Naloxone (Suboxone) to prevent injection/abuse.
    - Naltrexone (Antagonist, blocks opioid effects, requires full detoxification first, relapse prevention) - Oral or Long-acting injectable (Vivitrol).
