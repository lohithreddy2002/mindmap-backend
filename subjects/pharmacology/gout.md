## Gout

- **Pathogenesis**
  - Hyperuricemia
    - Definition: Serum urate > 6.8 mg/dL (supersaturation)
    - Causes
      - Increased Production (Lesch-Nyhan, myeloproliferative/lymphoproliferative disorders, psoriasis, tumor lysis syndrome, chemotherapy)
      - Decreased Excretion (CKD, certain drugs - diuretics, low dose aspirin, cyclosporine, niacin)
      - Combined
    - **Sodium Urate Crystal** formation (MSU - monosodium urate)
  - Crystal Deposition (Joints, soft tissues, kidney)
  - Acute Inflammation (Neutrophils, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha)

- **Clinical Presentation**
  - **Acute Gouty Arthritis**
    - Sudden onset, severe pain, swelling, redness, warmth
    - Monoarticular (initially)
    - **Podagra** (1st MTP joint) - most common site
    - Triggers (alcohol, purine-rich food, surgery, trauma, dehydration, certain medications)
  - **Intercritical Gout** (Asymptomatic period between attacks)
  - **Chronic Tophaceous Gout**
    - **Tophi** (urate crystal deposits in soft tissues - ears, elbows, fingers, joints)
    - Joint destruction, chronic pain, deformity

- **Diagnosis**
  - **Gold Standard**: Aspiration of synovial fluid
    - **Negatively birefringent** needle-shaped crystals under polarized light microscopy
  - Clinical Criteria (ACR/EULAR 2015 - not for cheat sheet detail, but know it exists)
  - Serum Uric Acid (Elevated, but not diagnostic alone - can be normal during acute attack)
  - Imaging
    - X-ray: Periarticular erosions with sclerotic margins ("punched-out" lesions), overhanging edge sign (late)
    - Ultrasound: Double contour sign, tophi, crystal aggregates

- **Differential Diagnosis**
  - Pseudogout (Calcium pyrophosphate deposition - CPPD)
    - Positively birefringent, rhomboid crystals
    - Often knees, wrists
    - Chondrocalcinosis on X-ray
  - Septic Arthritis (rule out!)
  - Cellulitis
  - Other inflammatory arthropathies

- **Management**
  - **Acute Attack**
    - Goal: Pain and inflammation relief
    - Medications
      - **NSAIDs** (Indomethacin, Naproxen) - first line (caution in CKD, GI issues)
      - **Colchicine** - best within 24-36 hours, anti-inflammatory, affects neutrophils (side effects: diarrhea, myelosuppression)
      - Corticosteroids (Oral, intra-articular, IV) - for NSAID/Colchicine contraindications/failure
  - **Chronic Management / Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT)**
    - Goal: Lower serum urate < 6 mg/dL (<5 mg/dL if severe/tophi)
    - Indications: Recurrent attacks, tophi, chronic gouty arthritis, gouty nephropathy, moderate-severe CKD, history of urolithiasis
    - Medications (initiated AFTER acute attack subsides, or with cover)
      - **Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors (XOI)**:
        - **Allopurinol** - most common. Dose adjustment in CKD. Risk of Allopurinol Hypersensitivity Syndrome (HLA-B*5801 association, especially in certain ethnicities).
        - **Febuxostat** - non-purine XOI. No dose adjustment in mild-moderate CKD/hepatic impairment. Potential cardiovascular concerns (controversial).
      - **Uricosurics**:
        - **Probenecid** - increases urate excretion. Requires adequate renal function, risk of stones (hydrate!). Contraindicated with history of stones.
      - **Urate Oxidase (Recombinant)**:
        - **Pegloticase** (IV) - converts urate to allantoin. For refractory chronic gout. Risk of infusion reactions, anaphylaxis, antibodies. Contraindicated in G6PD deficiency (hemolysis).
    - Prophylaxis during ULT initiation (Colchicine or low-dose NSAID for 3-6 months) to prevent flares

- **Complications**
  - Joint destruction, deformity
  - **Gouty Nephropathy** (Chronic interstitial nephritis)
  - **Urate Nephrolithiasis** (Uric acid stones) - radiolucent
  - Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, CKD

- **Associated Conditions**
  - Metabolic Syndrome (Obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance)
  - CKD
  - Cardiovascular Disease

- **Lifestyle Modifications**
  - Weight loss
  - Avoidance of high-purine foods (red meat, seafood)
  - Limit alcohol (especially beer), sugary drinks (fructose)
  - Hydration
