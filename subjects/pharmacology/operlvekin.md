## Operlvekin (rhIL-11)

- **Mechanism of Action**
  - Recombinant Human Interleukin-11
  - Stimulates proliferation & differentiation of megakaryocyte progenitors
  - Increases platelet production

- **Indication**
  - Prevention of severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia
  - Reduces need for platelet transfusions

- **Administration**
  - Subcutaneous injection
  - Started 6-24 hours *after* chemotherapy
  - Continued until platelet count reaches desired level (often >50,000 or >100,000) or for max 21 days

- **Key Side Effects**
  - **Fluid Retention**
    - Peripheral edema
    - Pleural effusion
    - Pulmonary edema
    - Ascites
    - Requires careful monitoring, especially in patients with heart/renal issues
  - **Cardiovascular**
    - Tachycardia
    - Palpitations
    - Atrial arrhythmias (esp. atrial fibrillation/flutter)
    - Exacerbation of heart failure
  - Fatigue
  - Headache
  - Dizziness
  - Visual disturbances (conjunctival injection, blurry vision)
  - Anemia (dilutional)

- **Contraindications/Precautions**
  - History of cardiac disease (use with caution)
  - Renal impairment (increased risk of fluid retention)
  - Myeloid malignancies (theoretical risk of stimulating tumor growth)
