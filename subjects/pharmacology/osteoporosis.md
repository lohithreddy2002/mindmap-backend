# Osteoporosis

## Definition
- Reduced Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
- Microarchitectural deterioration
- Increased fracture risk
- Silent disease until fracture

## Epidemiology
- Common in elderly
- Post-menopausal women > Men

## Pathophysiology
- Imbalance bone remodeling
- Bone resorption > Bone formation
- Osteoclast activity > Osteoblast activity

## Risk Factors
- Age (Elderly)
- **Female Gender**
- **Post-menopausal (Estrogen deficiency)**
- Genetics/Family history
- Race (Caucasian, Asian)
- Low BMI / Anorexia
- Lifestyle: Smoking, Excessive Alcohol, Sedentary lifestyle
- **Medications:**
    - **Glucocorticoids (Steroids)** - High Yield
    - Heparin
    - PPIs
    - Anticonvulsants
    - Thiazolidinediones
    - Aromatase inhibitors
- Medical Conditions:
    - Endocrine: Hyperparathyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Cushing's, Diabetes, Hypogonadism
    - GI: Malabsorption, Celiac disease, IBD, Bariatric surgery
    - Renal: Chronic Kidney Disease
    - Hematologic: Multiple Myeloma
    - Rheumatologic: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis

## Clinical Features
- Often Asymptomatic
- **Fragility Fractures:**
    - Occur with low-level trauma (fall from standing height or less)
    - **Vertebral Compression Fractures:**
        - Back pain
        - Loss of height
        - Kyphosis ("Dowager's hump")
    - **Hip Fractures:** High morbidity/mortality
    - **Distal Radius Fractures (Colles' Fracture)**
    - Pelvic fractures
    - Proximal Humerus fractures

## Diagnosis
- **DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry)** - Gold Standard
    - Measures BMD (grams/cm²)
    - **T-score:** Compares to young adult peak bone mass (used for post-menopausal women & men >50)
        - **Osteoporosis: T-score ≤ -2.5 SD**
        - Osteopenia: -1.0 > T-score > -2.5 SD
        - Normal: T-score ≥ -1.0 SD
    - **Z-score:** Compares to age-matched population (used for pre-menopausal women, men <50, children)
        - Z-score ≤ -2.0 SD considered below expected range (suggests secondary cause)
- X-rays: Detect fractures, not early disease
- Lab Tests: Rule out secondary causes (Calcium, Phosphate, PTH, Vit D, TSH, Creatinine, LFTs, SPEP/UPEP if suspect myeloma)
- **FRAX Tool:** Estimates 10-year probability of major osteoporotic and hip fracture (Uses risk factors, BMD optional)

## Types
- Primary Osteoporosis
    - **Post-menopausal (Type I):** Due to estrogen deficiency
    - **Senile (Type II):** Age-related bone loss (affects both cortical & trabecular bone)
- **Secondary Osteoporosis:** Due to underlying medical condition or medication

## Management
- **Non-Pharmacological:**
    - **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Adequate intake/supplements
    - Exercise: Weight-bearing, resistance training, balance training (fall prevention)
    - Fall Prevention strategies
    - Lifestyle modification: Quit smoking, Limit alcohol
- **Pharmacological:**
    - **Antiresorptive Agents:** Reduce bone breakdown
        - **Bisphosphonates:** **Alendronate**, Risedronate (oral, weekly/monthly), **Zoledronic acid** (IV, yearly). **High Yield:** Esophagitis (oral), ONJ (Osteonecrosis of the Jaw), Atypical femur fractures. Contraindicated in severe CKD.
        - **Denosumab:** Human monoclonal antibody, Inhibits **RANKL** (Given SC q6 months). **High Yield:** Hypocalcemia, ONJ, Atypical fractures, Rebound fractures if stopped.
        - SERMs (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators): **Raloxifene**. Good for vertebral fracture prevention, reduces breast cancer risk, but increases DVT/PE risk.
        - Calcitonin: Nasal spray/injection, Less effective for fracture reduction, mainly for pain of acute vertebral fracture.
    - **Anabolic Agents:** Build bone (Used for severe osteoporosis, high fracture risk, or treatment failure)
        - **Teriparatide:** Recombinant **PTH (1-34)** (Given SC daily, max 2 years). **High Yield:** Osteosarcoma risk (theoretical), Hypercalcemia.
        - **Romosozumab:** Monoclonal antibody, inhibits **Sclerostin** (Given SC monthly for 12 months). **High Yield:** CV risk, ONJ, Atypical fractures.
    - Combination Therapy: Sometimes used in severe cases (e.g., Teriparatide + Denosumab)

## Complications
- Fractures (Vertebral, Hip, Wrist, etc.)
- Pain
- Disability
- Loss of height
- Kyphosis
- Reduced quality of life
- Increased mortality (especially hip fractures)

## Prevention
- Adequate Calcium & Vitamin D intake (especially in childhood & adolescence)
- Regular Weight-bearing Exercise
- Avoid smoking & excessive alcohol
- Identify & manage secondary causes/medications
- Early screening (DEXA) for high-risk individuals
