## Antispasmodics

- Classification
  - Anticholinergic (Muscarinic Antagonists)
    - MOA: Block acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in smooth muscle
    - Examples
      - Hyoscine Butylbromide (Buscopan)
        - Quaternary amine: Poor CNS penetration
        - Rapid onset
      - Dicyclomine
        - Tertiary amine: Crosses BBB -> More CNS SE
      - Atropine (less used specifically as antispasmodic)
  - Direct Smooth Muscle Relaxants
    - MOA: Diverse mechanisms (e.g., calcium channel blockade, phosphodiesterase inhibition)
    - Examples
      - Mebeverine
        - Reduces smooth muscle spasm without affecting normal motility
      - Alverine
        - Affects calcium channels
      - Drotaverine
        - Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor
      - Otilonium Bromide
        - Calcium channel blocker, Quaternary ammonium
- Indications
  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
    - Especially for pain and spasm
  - Biliary Colic
  - Renal Colic
  - Dysmenorrhea
  - Diverticular Disease (symptomatic relief)
  - Endoscopy/Radiology procedures (to relax GIT)
- Side Effects (Mainly Anticholinergics)
  - Dry mouth (Xerostomia)
  - Blurred vision (Cycloplegia, Mydriasis)
  - Urinary retention
  - Constipation
  - Tachycardia
  - CNS effects (Drowsiness, Confusion - more with tertiary amines)
- Contraindications
  - Angle-closure Glaucoma
  - Prostatic Hypertrophy / Urinary Outlet Obstruction
  - Paralytic Ileus / Obstructive Gut Lesions
  - Myasthenia Gravis
  - Tachyarrhythmias
  - Severe Ulcerative Colitis (risk of toxic megacolon with anticholinergics)
- INICET Buzz Words
  - IBS pain

  - Hyoscine
  - Dicyclomine
  - Mebeverine
  - Anticholinergic side effects
  - Urinary retention
  - Glaucoma contraindication
  - Buscopan
