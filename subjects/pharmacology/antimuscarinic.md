## Antimuscarinics

- ### Mechanism
  - Competitive antagonists
  - Block Acetylcholine at Muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5)

- ### Effects / Clinical Features
  - **Eye:** Mydriasis, Cycloplegia (Loss of accommodation), Elevated IOP (Risk in angle-closure glaucoma)
  - **Heart:** Tachycardia (Initial transient bradycardia then dominant tachycardia)
  - **GI:** Decreased motility & tone, Reduced secretions, Constipation
  - **GU:** Bladder relaxation, Sphincter contraction, Urinary Retention
  - **Respiratory:** Bronchodilation, Decreased secretions
  - **Glands:** Anhydrosis (Dry skin), Xerostomia (Dry mouth), Decreased bronchial/nasal secretions
  - **CNS (Tertiary amines):** Stimulation, Restlessness, Excitation, Delirium, Hallucinations (High doses); Sedation, Amnesia (Scopolamine - low dose)

- ### Therapeutic Uses (High Yield)
  - **Atropine:**
    - Symptomatic Bradycardia
    - Organophosphate Poisoning / Cholinergic Crisis (Antidote)
    - Pre-anesthesia (Reduce secretions, Prevent bradycardia)
    - Ophthalmic (Mydriasis, Cycloplegia - long duration)
  - **Scopolamine:**
    - Motion Sickness (Transdermal patch)
    - Pre-anesthesia (Sedation, Amnesia)
  - **Ipratropium / Tiotropium:**
    - COPD & Asthma (Bronchodilation)
    - Quaternary ammonium - less systemic side effects
  - **Oxybutynin / Tolterodine / Solifenacin / Darifenacin:**
    - Overactive Bladder (OAB) / Urinary Incontinence
    - Often M3 selective emphasis
  - **Benztropine / Trihexyphenidyl:**
    - Drug-induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)
    - Adjunct in Parkinsonism (especially tremor/rigidity)
  - **Tropicamide / Cyclopentolate:**
    - Ophthalmic (Mydriasis, Cycloplegia - short duration)

- ### Adverse Effects (Anticholinergic Syndrome)
  - "Hot as a hare" (Hyperthermia due to anhidrosis)
  - "Blind as a bat" (Blurred vision, Mydriasis, Photophobia)
  - "Dry as a bone" (Dry mouth, Dry skin)
  - "Red as a beet" (Flushed skin)
  - "Mad as a hatter" (Confusion, Delirium, Hallucinations, Psychosis - especially in elderly)
  - Urinary Retention
  - Constipation
  - Tachycardia

- ### Contraindications
  - Angle-Closure Glaucoma
  - Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) / Obstructive Uropathy
  - Obstructive GI Disease (Paralytic Ileus, Pyloric Stenosis)
  - Severe Ulcerative Colitis (Risk of Toxic Megacolon)
  - Myasthenia Gravis (Relative)
  - Children (Risk of hyperthermia - Atropine Fever)

- ### Toxicity Management
  - **Antidote:** Physostigmine (Cholinesterase inhibitor that crosses BBB - for central and peripheral effects)
  - Supportive care
