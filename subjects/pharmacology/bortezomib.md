## Bortezomib
- **Mechanism of Action**
    - 26S Proteasome Inhibitor
    - Blocks degradation of ubiquitinated proteins
    - Accumulation of pro-apoptotic factors (p53, p21, IκB)
    - Disruption of NF-κB pathway
    - Induces apoptosis in cancer cells
    - Boron atom is critical for binding
- **Indications**
    - Multiple Myeloma (MM)
        - Newly diagnosed
        - Relapsed/Refractory
    - Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
- **High-Yield Adverse Effects**
    - Peripheral Neuropathy
        - Most common dose-limiting toxicity
        - Sensory > Motor
        - Often reversible, but can be persistent
        - Less with Subcutaneous administration
    - Hematologic
        - Thrombocytopenia
        - Neutropenia
    - Gastrointestinal
        - Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Constipation
    - Fatigue
    - Herpes Zoster Reactivation
        - **Requires prophylaxis** (e.g., Acyclovir)
    - Postural Hypotension
    - Pulmonary toxicity (less common but serious)
- **Administration**
    - Intravenous (IV)
    - Subcutaneous (SubQ) - **Preferred**
        - Similar efficacy, significantly reduced Peripheral Neuropathy
- **Common Regimens (in MM)**
    - VRD (Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone)
    - VCD (Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide, Dexamethasone)
    - VTD (Bortezomib, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone)
- **Key INICET Buzzwords**
    - **Proteasome Inhibitor**
    - **Multiple Myeloma**
    - **Peripheral Neuropathy**
    - **Subcutaneous Administration (Reduced toxicity)**
    - **Herpes Zoster Prophylaxis**
    - **26S Proteasome**
    - **Boron Atom**
    - **VRD**
